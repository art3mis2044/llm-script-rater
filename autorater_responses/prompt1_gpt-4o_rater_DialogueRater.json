  "justification": "The dialogue in 'The Box in the Attic' demonstrates strong naturalism, particularly in the sibling-like banter and the organic flow of conversation, including interruptions. Anna and Leo each possess a distinct and consistent character voice: Anna is portrayed as pragmatic, organized, and analytical, while Leo is impulsive, imaginative, and playful. This clear differentiation is one of the script's strengths. The dialogue effectively advances the plot by introducing the central mystery of the locked box and setting the immediate goal of finding its key. It also successfully establishes a lighthearted, familial tone with an underlying sense of gentle mystery. Subtext is present in their differing approaches to the grandmother's belongings and their contrasting personalities, hinting at deeper individual perspectives on memory and respect. However, while present, the subtext could be more layered or complex, occasionally leaning a bit directly into their character traits rather than leaving more unsaid. Overall, it's a very solid foundation for a scene.",

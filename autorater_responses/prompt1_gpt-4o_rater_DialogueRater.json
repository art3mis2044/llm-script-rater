  "justification": "The dialogue clearly distinguishes the two characters' personalities, establishing a functional dynamic between the pragmatic Anna and the whimsical Leo. However, it lacks naturalism and relies heavily on on-the-nose exposition. The characters frequently verbalize the scene's themes and their own emotional states (e.g., 'Spontaneity and I haven't exactly been on speaking terms') rather than allowing them to emerge through subtext. The resolution feels somewhat clich\u00e9, with the dialogue leaning into sentimental tropes rather than authentic sibling interaction.",

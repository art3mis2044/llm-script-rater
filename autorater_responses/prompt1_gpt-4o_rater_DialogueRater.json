  "justification": "The dialogue is highly naturalistic, effectively capturing a believable sibling dynamic with authentic banter and reactions. Each character possesses a distinct and consistent voice; Anna is grounded and subtly melancholic, while Leo is playful, theatrical, and spontaneous. The script skillfully hints at Anna's underlying emotional struggles and Leo's perceptive, caring nature through their contrasting approaches and subtle phrasing, providing effective subtext. Functionally, the dialogue excels by driving the plot's progression from a mundane task to a poignant discovery, revealing character through their interactions, and establishing a tone that gracefully shifts from lighthearted to reflective. The pacing feels authentic, leading to a satisfying emotional resolution.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes a clear dynamic between the two siblings through sharp, contrasting voices. Anna\u2019s lines reflect her pragmatic nature through technical descriptions and a focus on order, while Leo\u2019s voice is energetic and hyperbolic, capturing his free-spirited persona perfectly. The banter feels natural and grounded in a shared history, particularly with the specific anecdote about the crosswalk. While the scene relies on some familiar tropes (the uptight vs. messy sibling) and the 'rock, paper, scissors' resolution is a common dramatic shorthand, the dialogue successfully manages to weave character revelation and plot progression together. There is a nice moment of subtext when they pivot from greed/curiosity to a shared hesitation regarding their grandmother's privacy.",

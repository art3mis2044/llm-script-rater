  "justification": "The script features exceptionally distinct character voices, particularly the two grandmothers whose contrasting vocabularies (Vegas slang vs. formal traditionalism) drive the comedy and immediately establish the conflict. The dialogue functions well to advance the plot toward a chaotic climax and maintains a consistent comedic tone throughout. However, the dialogue lacks deep subtext, as characters' motivations and their dislike for one another are stated very explicitly rather than hinted at. Additionally, the naturalism is slightly compromised by 'sitcom-style' zingers that feel a bit more scripted than spontaneous, though they serve the specific genre well.",
  "score": 7.5

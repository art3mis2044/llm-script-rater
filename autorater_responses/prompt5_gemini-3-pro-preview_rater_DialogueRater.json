  "justification": "The dialogue is highly stylized and leans heavily into caricature, which makes for distinct character voices but completely sacrifices naturalism and subtext. Every character states their internal state or archetype directly (e.g., 'Align your chakras!', 'Sell the crypto!'), leaving no room for nuance or realistic human interaction. While the dialogue functions well to establish a frantic, absurdist tone and manages a large ensemble efficiently, it feels more like a collection of punchlines and tropes than a cohesive dramatic scene.",

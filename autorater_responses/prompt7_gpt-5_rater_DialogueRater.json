  "justification": "The dialogue is exceptionally effective at juggling a large ensemble cast within a tight, high-stakes scenario. Each character possesses a distinct linguistic thumbprint, from Alejo\u2019s salt-weathered resignation to Kai\u2019s modern, gig-economy-driven anxiety. The subtext is handled skillfully, particularly in Jules's internal conflict between the recorded evacuation orders and his father's instructions, and Priya\u2019s struggle with the cold arithmetic of her job. While Victor\u2019s character borders on a corporate trope, his dialogue serves the necessary function of highlighting the indifference of nature to human status. The ending successfully captures the requested ambiguity and sadness through a mix of muffled sound and silence.",

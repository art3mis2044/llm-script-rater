  "justification": "The dialogue is highly effective at establishing six distinct character voices in a very short amount of time, which is the script's greatest strength. Each character\u2014from the neurotic planner to the cynical observer\u2014speaks with a consistent and recognizable tone. While the dialogue leans into comedic tropes rather than raw naturalism, it perfectly serves the 'comedic skit' genre. The plot is advanced efficiently through the dialogue, and although there is very little subtext (emotions and motivations are stated quite explicitly), the functional nature of the lines ensures the humor lands and the scene remains paced well.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is exceptionally strong in establishing distinct character voices that are both natural and consistently reflect their personalities. Each character's unique way of speaking\u2014from Leo's frantic, schedule-obsessed lines to Chloe's influencer jargon, Jake's over-the-top fears, Maya's anxious bladder concerns, Sam's dry sarcasm, and Bella's grounded pragmatism\u2014makes them instantly recognizable and believable. Subtext is cleverly woven into their reactions, revealing underlying anxieties, coping mechanisms, and motivations without explicit exposition. The dialogue functions perfectly to advance the comedic horror plot, moving from minor discomfort to rising panic and culminating in a hilarious parental intervention. It effectively establishes the lighthearted yet tense tone, skillfully balancing the teenagers' exaggerated fears with the parents' exasperated authority. It's a highly effective and entertaining piece of writing that fulfills all criteria with distinction.",

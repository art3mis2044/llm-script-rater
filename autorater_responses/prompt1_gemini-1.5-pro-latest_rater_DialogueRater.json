  "justification": "The dialogue excels in establishing two incredibly distinct and consistent character voices. Leo's theatrical exuberance perfectly contrasts with Anna's grounded practicality, creating an engaging and comedic dynamic. It effectively advances the plot, driving the action around the mysterious box and setting up the discovery of its contents. The tone is clearly established as lighthearted and adventurous. Subtext is subtly woven into their contrasting motivations \u2013 Leo's desire for excitement and Anna's more methodical respect for their grandmother's legacy \u2013 as well as their underlying sibling affection and exasperation. While Leo's lines are often heightened and less strictly naturalistic in an everyday sense, they are perfectly natural *for his character's theatrical persona* and are well-balanced by Anna's more grounded responses, making the overall dialogue feel authentic within the play's style.",

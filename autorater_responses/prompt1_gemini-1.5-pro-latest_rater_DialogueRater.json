  "justification": "The dialogue in 'Attic Symphony' is exceptionally well-crafted, earning high marks across all criteria. \n\n**Naturalism (9/10):** The banter between Anna and Leo feels incredibly authentic for siblings. Their playful jabs, Anna's exasperated but fond responses, and Leo's theatricality ring true to a long-standing relationship. Lines like 'Another box of doilies' or 'You lack a sense of wonder, Anna' sound like real-life conversations, making the scene highly relatable.\n\n**Character Voice (10/10):** Anna and Leo possess distinct and consistent voices. Anna's is grounded, practical, and a touch dry, while Leo's is imaginative, impulsive, and dramatic. This contrast is the engine of their interaction, with each line reinforcing their established personalities without ever feeling forced or repetitive. The costume choices even align perfectly with their spoken words.\n\n**Subtext (8/10):** The dialogue subtly hints at deeper layers. Anna's weariness with Leo suggests a long history of being the more responsible sibling, while Leo's constant search for 'treasure' or 'magic' could be interpreted as a coping mechanism for the potentially melancholic task of clearing an attic, or simply his innate way of engaging with the world. The shift in their demeanor after discovering the baby clothes, from initial surprise to a shared, softer moment, carries an unspoken emotional weight about memory, family, and unexpected tenderness. The final stage direction confirms this shift, which is entirely earned by the preceding dialogue.\n\n**Function (9/10):** The dialogue expertly serves multiple functions. It advances the micro-plot of finding and opening the mysterious box. It profoundly reveals character, establishing Anna as practical and Leo as whimsical, and showcasing their sibling dynamic. Furthermore, it successfully establishes a tone that is initially light and comedic, then subtly shifts to a warmer, more reflective feeling by the scene's end, especially with the unexpected contents of the box.",

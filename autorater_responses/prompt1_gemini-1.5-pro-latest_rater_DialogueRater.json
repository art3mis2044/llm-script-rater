  "justification": "The dialogue excels in establishing incredibly distinct and consistent character voices for Anna and Leo, which is its greatest strength. Anna's pragmatic, slightly exasperated voice perfectly contrasts with Leo's exuberant, theatrical, and impulsive declarations, creating an engaging and comedic dynamic. The dialogue is highly functional, successfully advancing the plot, revealing their personalities and relationship, and firmly establishing a lighthearted, adventurous tone. There's effective subtext, particularly in Anna's reactions to Leo and their established banter, hinting at a comfortable, sibling-like relationship and their individual ways of processing the task at hand. The primary consideration regarding naturalism is Leo's dialogue; while Anna's lines are very grounded and realistic, Leo's are intentionally exaggerated and theatrical. This choice, however, serves his character brilliantly and contributes significantly to the scene's comedic energy and unique voice, making it a stylistic success rather than a flaw in a theatrical context. Overall, the dialogue is vivid, entertaining, and highly effective.",

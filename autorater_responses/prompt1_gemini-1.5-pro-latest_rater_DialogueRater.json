  "justification": "The dialogue in 'Attic Symphony' is exceptionally strong. It demonstrates high naturalism, sounding authentically like a conversation between siblings with a shared history. Each character, Anna and Leo, possesses a distinct and consistent voice: Anna is practical, grounded, and slightly exasperated, while Leo is whimsical, dramatic, and a seeker of wonder. Their contrasting personalities are beautifully highlighted through their speech patterns and choice of words. There's a good amount of subtext, particularly in their long-standing sibling dynamic \u2013 Anna's patient annoyance, Leo's desire for excitement \u2013 and their differing approaches to processing memories. The dialogue successfully advances the simple plot of sorting through the attic, effectively reveals the characters' personalities and their relationship, and establishes a charming, comedic, yet ultimately warm and reflective tone.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional and establishes distinct, contrasting character voices that clearly delineate the 'hip' versus 'traditional' archetypes required by the prompt. However, the script lacks subtext; characters state their motivations and traits explicitly (e.g., 'I'm an influencer' or 'This family has lost all sense of decorum'). While the pacing is effective for a comedic sketch, the naturalism is low as the lines lean heavily on sitcom tropes and 'on-the-nose' exposition rather than organic human interaction.",

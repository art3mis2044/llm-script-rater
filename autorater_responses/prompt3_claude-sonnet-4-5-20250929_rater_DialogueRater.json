  "justification": "The dialogue in this script is exceptionally strong and well-crafted. It achieves a high degree of naturalism, making the chaotic family interactions feel authentic, even with the comedic exaggerations. Each character possesses a distinct and consistent voice: Margaret's stressed exasperation, Tom's well-meaning cluelessness, Lily's apathetic teen commentary, and especially the stark contrast between Grandma Viv's flamboyant irreverence and Grandma Ruth's prim traditionalism. This clear character voice is a major strength, driving much of the humor and conflict. Subtext is cleverly woven throughout, particularly in the grandmas' jabs, Margaret's desperate attempts at control, and Lily's desire to escape, all hinting at deeper, long-standing family dynamics without explicit exposition. Functionally, the dialogue excels; it rapidly advances the plot through escalating absurdity, vividly reveals each character's personality and their relationships, and firmly establishes a hilarious, relatable tone of Thanksgiving dysfunction. The rapid-fire exchanges and well-timed comedic beats ensure the dialogue is engaging and effective.",

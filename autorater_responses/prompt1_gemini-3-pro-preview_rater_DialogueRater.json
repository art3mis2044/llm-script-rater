  "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes a clear contrast between the two siblings, using their professional and personal leanings (architecture vs. whimsy) to drive the conflict. Anna's pragmatic approach and Leo's dramatic flair are consistently maintained throughout the scene. The script does a good job of using the physical objects to reveal character history\u2014specifically the mention of the five-legged dog drawing\u2014which adds a layer of emotional subtext to their bickering. While some lines feel slightly 'written' rather than spoken (e.g., the structural load joke), the voices are distinct, and the dialogue serves the dual purpose of moving the plot forward while grounding the characters in a believable, if slightly heightened, sibling dynamic.",

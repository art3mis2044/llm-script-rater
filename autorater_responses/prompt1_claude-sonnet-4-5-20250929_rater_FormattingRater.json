  "score": 9.2,
  "justification": "The script demonstrates excellent adherence to theatrical formatting with properly capitalized and centered character cues, well-formatted dialogue, and sparingly used, correctly placed parentheticals, though it employs a descriptive 'SETTING' and 'AT RISE' rather than the 'INT. LOCATION - DAY' style of scene heading exemplified."

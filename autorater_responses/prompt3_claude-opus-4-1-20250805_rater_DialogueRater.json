  "justification": "The script does an excellent job of creating distinct character voices, particularly the two grandmothers whose contrasting vocabularies and attitudes provide clear comedic conflict. The dialogue is highly functional, efficiently establishing the chaotic tone and hitting all the required prompt beats within a short space. However, it lacks naturalism and subtext; the characters frequently state exactly what they are feeling or doing (e.g., Janet's 'Everything's FINE' or the grandmas' immediate insults), which makes the dialogue feel more like a series of sitcom punchlines rather than an organic conversation. While the 'on-the-nose' writing serves the farce, it prevents the dialogue from having any emotional depth or nuance.",

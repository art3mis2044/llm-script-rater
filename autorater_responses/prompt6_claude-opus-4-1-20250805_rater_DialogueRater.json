  "justification": "The dialogue in 'Camping Catastrophe' is exceptionally well-crafted for a comedic short. Each character possesses a distinct, consistent, and instantly recognizable voice, driving much of the humor through their individual quirks and reactions. The lines generally sound natural for teenagers, even with the comedic exaggerations that enhance the character types and plot. The dialogue functions perfectly to advance the simple plot, escalate the comedic tension, and reveal character motivations and flaws effectively. While deep, hidden subtext is not a primary goal for this type of script, the dialogue successfully hints at underlying insecurities (Ethan's bravado, Jade's influencer persona, Maya's need for control) without explicitly stating them. The rapid-fire exchanges and sharp punchlines contribute to a lively and engaging tone.",

  "justification": "The script does an excellent job of creating six distinct and consistent character voices, adhering strictly to the archetypes established in the prompt. Each character's dialogue immediately identifies their personality\u2014from Maya\u2019s rigid planning to Jade\u2019s social media obsession. The dialogue functions well to advance the plot quickly and maintains a consistent comedic tone. However, the dialogue lacks naturalism and subtext; characters often speak in 'on-the-nose' tropes, explicitly stating their traits or current feelings rather than allowing them to emerge naturally through conversation. It feels more like a sketch comedy piece where characters are caricatures rather than real people.",

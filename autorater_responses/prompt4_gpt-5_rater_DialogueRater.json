  "justification": "The dialogue in 'Smoke Signals' is exceptionally well-crafted and performs strongly across all criteria. Each character possesses a highly distinct and consistent voice, from Judd and Jagger's hyperbolic competitive banter to Lena's sharp wit, Milo's gentle sincerity, and Mrs. Alvarez's dry pragmatism. This strong characterization is consistently revealed and advanced through their words, making the cast immediately recognizable and engaging. The script skillfully employs subtext, particularly in the burgeoning connection between Lena and Milo, whose shared looks, collaborative actions, and subtle exchanges convey much without being overtly stated. The dads' gradual softening and the underlying affection beneath their rivalry are also effectively communicated through implied shifts in dialogue and behavior, especially after the sprinkler incident. Functionally, the dialogue excels: it drives the plot forward with clear progression, illuminating character motivations and relationships, and establishing a charming, comedic, and warm tone throughout. While the dads' lines occasionally lean into theatrical exaggeration for comedic effect, this serves their larger-than-life competitive personas and contributes positively to the script's overall theatrical naturalism, making the dialogue feel authentic and believable within its specific context.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional, effectively establishing the comedic tone and advancing the plot through sharp, character-specific banter. The voices of the two dads are distinct and thematic, though their 'punny' nature sacrifices some naturalism for stylistic effect. The teenagers' dialogue feels slightly more authentic, providing a necessary groundedness. While the subtext is minimal\u2014most feelings and rivalries are expressed overtly\u2014the dialogue successfully manages a large cast and multiple comedic beats within a short span.",

  "justification": "The dialogue in 'Turbulent Souls' is exceptionally strong, especially for a short scene designed to introduce multiple characters quickly. Each character possesses a distinct and consistent voice, making them instantly recognizable \u2013 from Doris's rambling anecdotes to Tiffany's influencer jargon and Agnes's hysterical pronouncements. This excels in character voice (10/10).\n\nThe dialogue feels largely naturalistic within the heightened reality of a comedic play. The exasperated responses, the mundane conversations amidst chaos, and even Brenda's melodramatic breakdown, while extreme, feel organically derived from their character's personality and the escalating situation. It serves the comedic tone very well, even if a verbatim recording of real life wouldn't be quite as dramatic (8/10 for naturalism).\n\nSubtext is present and effective. Mike's journey from internal exasperation to unhinged calm, punctuated by his final line, is full of implied meaning. Brenda's breakdown, while direct in its emotional outpouring, uses the mundane detail of the air fryer to hint at deeper feelings of betrayal and loss. Agnes's sudden shift to empathetic shock also provides a nice moment of subtext (8/10 for subtext).\n\nFunctionally, the dialogue is outstanding. It rapidly establishes a chaotic tone, introduces a diverse cast of characters with clear personalities, and propels the comedic plot forward through escalating reactions to the turbulence. Brenda's monologue acts as a brilliant turning point, momentarily silencing the chaos and shifting the emotional landscape of the cabin. It successfully advances the plot, reveals character, and firmly establishes the play's unique comedic tone (10/10 for function).\n\nOverall, this script demonstrates excellent control over dialogue for character, plot, and tone.",

  "justification": "The script does an excellent job of giving each character a distinct voice despite the large cast, and the dialogue effectively establishes a chaotic, absurdist tone. Mike and Leo\u2019s final exchange provides a grounded, slightly more nuanced moment that serves as a strong button for the scene. However, the dialogue lacks subtext, as almost every character explicitly states their internal state (e.g., Barbara's fear, Chloe's heartbreak, the Influencer's 'vibe'). Additionally, some of the 'eccentric' characters rely on generic tropes (the finance bro, the influencer) which makes their lines feel more like caricatures than naturalistic speech.",

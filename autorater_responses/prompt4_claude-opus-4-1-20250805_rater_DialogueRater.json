  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional, successfully establishing the conflict and character dynamics within a very short timeframe. However, it lacks naturalism and subtext, opting for 'on-the-nose' exposition and sitcom-style punchlines. While the distinction between the 'dads' and the 'teens' is clear, the individual voices within those pairs are nearly identical. The subtext is minimal, as characters explicitly state their feelings and secrets\u2014such as being vegetarians\u2014without any nuance or layering.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is functional and clearly establishes the 'hectic morning' tone, but it suffers from a lack of naturalism and subtext. The characters speak in polished, sitcom-style quips rather than realistic fragments typical of a busy morning. For example, lines like 'monarchy of midday meals' and 'ship of breakfast' feel overly performative and written. Character voices are distinct but lean heavily on archetypes (the sarcastic teen, the imaginative child, the bumbling father) without much depth. Subtext is minimal; the characters frequently state the theme of the scene directly (e.g., 'Well, that\u2019s the circus for another morning'), leaving little for the audience to infer.",

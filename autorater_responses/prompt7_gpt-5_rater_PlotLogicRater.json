  "score": 6.0,
  "justification": "While the script features strong atmospheric writing and distinct character voices, the climax suffers from a major logical inconsistency: both Jules and his father are described as ending up on the 'city side' (safety), yet the conclusion treats them as tragically separated by the barrier."

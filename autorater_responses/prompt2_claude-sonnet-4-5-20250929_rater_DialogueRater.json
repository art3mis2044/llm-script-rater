Each character possesses a distinct, consistent, and highly believable voice, from Emma's dramatic teenage angst to Jake's imaginative play and Sophie's tactical pragmatism. Subtext is skillfully woven throughout, hinting at Diane's underlying stress and the children's deeper motivations without explicit exposition. The dialogue functions perfectly to drive the comedic plot, revealing character through their unique expressions and reactions, and establishing a tone of relatable domestic pandemonium. The pacing is excellent, contributing to the escalating tension and humor, making it highly effective and engaging.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively fulfills the prompt's requirements by establishing a clear, frantic tone and giving each of the five characters a distinct archetype (the frazzled mother, the dramatic teen, the precocious youngest). However, the script relies heavily on sitcom clich\u00e9s, such as the 'space commander' child and the teen calling a minor inconvenience 'child abuse,' which hinders its naturalism. There is virtually no subtext, as every character states their needs and emotions directly on the nose. While the dialogue serves its function in advancing the plot and setting the comedic tone, the voices feel more like stock characters than realistic individuals.",

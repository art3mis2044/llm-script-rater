{
  "justification": "The dialogue is heavily expository and lacks naturalism, with characters explicitly stating their motivations and the scene's themes rather than letting them emerge through subtext. The voices of the two fathers are nearly identical, and the teenagers lack a distinct or authentic adolescent voice, sounding more like placeholders for the plot. While the dialogue successfully fulfills the specific requirements of the prompt and moves the story from conflict to resolution, it relies on tropes and 'on-the-nose' declarations (e.g., 'Maybe there's hope for some peace after all') rather than nuanced character development.",

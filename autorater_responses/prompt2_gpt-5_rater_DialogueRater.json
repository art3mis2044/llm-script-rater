  "justification": "The dialogue in this script is exceptionally strong across all criteria. Its **naturalism** is outstanding; the rapid-fire exchanges, the children's non-sequiturs, the parents' blend of exasperation and coping humor, and the general chaotic rhythm perfectly mimic a real-life family morning. Each **character voice** is distinct and consistent: Maya's harried organization, Dan's goofy optimism and attempts at humor, Max's literal scientific focus, and Lila's imaginative antics shine through every line. The **subtext** is subtly woven in, revealing Maya's deep exhaustion and underlying love, Dan's coping mechanisms, and the family's shared history of peculiar events without explicitly stating these emotions. Finally, the dialogue is highly **functional**, serving to brilliantly advance the 'plot' of merely getting out the door, revealing each character's personality with precision, and consistently establishing a tone that is humorous, warm, and frantic. The wit is sharp, the pacing is excellent, and every line contributes meaningfully to the overall comedic and heartfelt chaos.",

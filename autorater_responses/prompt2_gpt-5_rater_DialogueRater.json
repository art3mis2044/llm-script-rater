  "justification": "The script features exceptionally distinct character voices, particularly the contrast between Max\u2019s clinical, scientific jargon and Lila\u2019s whimsical, imaginative logic. The dialogue functions perfectly to escalate the chaos, weaving multiple plot threads (the science project, the work calls, the pets) into a cohesive, fast-paced rhythm. While the dialogue is highly entertaining, it leans slightly into 'sitcom' territory where every line is a polished zinger, which slightly diminishes the naturalism and leaves little room for subtle subtext, as most emotions and stakes are stated explicitly for comedic effect.",

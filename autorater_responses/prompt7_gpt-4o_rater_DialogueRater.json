  "justification": "The dialogue effectively fulfills the basic requirements of the scene but relies heavily on archetypal tropes and expository phrasing. While each character has a distinct 'type' (the sarcastic student, the weary professional), their voices lack individual depth, making the interactions feel somewhat formulaic. There is very little subtext, as characters tend to state their motivations and fears directly (e.g., 'I have a presentation,' 'Not today'). However, the dialogue successfully drives the narrative toward the climax and maintains the intended somber tone.",

  "justification": "The script excels in 'Character Voice' and 'Function.' Managing 12+ distinct characters in a two-page scene is a significant challenge, yet the writer gives each a unique, recognizable verbal identity (e.g., the snack poet's alliteration, the conspiracy theorist's 'wing wigglers,' and the flight attendant's breakup metaphors). The dialogue effectively moves the plot from chaos to a thematic resolution. However, the 'Naturalism' is quite low, as the characters speak in high-concept tropes and theatrical caricatures rather than like real people in a crisis. 'Subtext' is also limited; while the flight attendant uses metaphors to process her grief, most characters explicitly state exactly what they are thinking and feeling at all times.",

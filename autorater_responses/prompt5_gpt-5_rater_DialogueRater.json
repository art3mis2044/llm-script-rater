  "justification": "The dialogue is exceptionally strong in establishing distinct and memorable character voices. Each passenger, from the terrified Patty to the poetic Felix and the conspiracy-theorist Earl, has a unique and consistent way of speaking that defines them instantly. Skyler's breakdown over the intercom is a brilliant use of dialogue for both character revelation and plot advancement, providing a powerful emotional anchor amidst the chaos. Mike serves as a grounding, relatable observer whose internal monologues effectively guide the audience. Subtext is evident in Skyler's vulnerability and Patty's underlying fear, hinting at deeper emotions without overstating them. The dialogue masterfully functions to drive the narrative tension (the turbulence), reveal the varied coping mechanisms of the characters, and establish a very specific tone of comedic absurdity mixed with genuine human anxiety and connection. While some lines lean into exaggeration, they are natural for the *archetypes* presented and perfectly suit the play's heightened reality, making them effective and internally consistent rather than feeling unnatural.",

{
  "justification": "The dialogue is functional but heavily reliant on exposition and archetypes. Characters explicitly state their traits and feelings rather than revealing them through subtext; for example, Grandma Kate's lines feel more like a summary of her character description than natural speech. While the voices are distinct, they are one-dimensional, and the 'conflict' between the grandmas is stated directly rather than felt through nuanced interaction. It serves the plot and setting well but lacks the realism and depth found in professional theatrical writing.",

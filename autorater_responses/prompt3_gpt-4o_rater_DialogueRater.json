  "justification": "The dialogue is a strong point of this script. Character voices are exceptionally well-defined, particularly for Grandma Doris and Grandma Kate, whose contrasting personalities drive engaging and humorous interactions. Their distinct ways of speaking not only reveal their individual characters but also create a clear dynamic. The dialogue feels natural for a family gathering, skillfully balancing exasperation from the parents, childlike playfulness, and the grandmas' bickering. Subtext is effectively woven in, hinting at underlying tensions and affection without being overly explicit (e.g., John and Maria's efforts to keep the peace, and the subtle jabs between the grandmas that reveal their deeper opinions). Functionally, the dialogue excels at introducing characters, establishing their relationships, advancing the immediate scene's micro-plot (managing holiday chaos and building towards a toast), and firmly setting a warm, comedic tone. The pet chicken, Goose, acts as a wonderful focal point for humor and character interaction.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively captures the frantic energy of a domestic morning with distinct voices for each family member. Sarah\u2019s exasperation and Mark\u2019s oblivious optimism are well-defined through their speech patterns. While the writing leans toward a 'sitcom' heightened reality rather than pure naturalism\u2014with lines like 'Pop-Tart and a prayer' feeling slightly scripted\u2014it serves the comedic function and genre perfectly. The dialogue successfully advances the plot through the rising chaos of the 'smoothie' subplot and reveals character dynamics with minimal exposition, though the subtext is relatively thin as most characters state exactly what they are thinking.",

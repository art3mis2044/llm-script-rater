  "justification": "The script excels in establishing distinct character voices, particularly with the two grandmothers whose contrasting vocabularies (Vegas-slang vs. traditionalist/religious) create immediate friction. The dialogue efficiently handles a complex 'Goose' subplot involving wordplay and misunderstandings. While the dialogue leans heavily into sitcom-style 'heightened' reality rather than strict naturalism, it serves the comedic function perfectly. The subtext is somewhat thin as characters tend to state their feelings and the central conflict directly, but the overall rhythm and pacing of the banter are professional and engaging.",

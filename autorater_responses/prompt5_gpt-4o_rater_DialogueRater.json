  "justification": "The dialogue is heavily reliant on archetypes and clich\u00e9s, resulting in a lack of naturalism and subtext. Each character speaks their internal state or gimmick directly (e.g., the Knitter's metaphor about life being a knitting project), which removes any depth. While the voices are distinct, they are one-dimensional, and the dialogue functions more as a checklist of character traits rather than a realistic or nuanced interaction. The flight attendant's intercom breakdown is entirely on-the-nose, lacking the realistic friction or absurdity that would make the scene truly effective.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes a range of distinct and often comedic character voices, from Mike's relatable teenage angst and the Laid Back Guitarist's zen philosophy to the Flight Attendant's surprisingly personal meltdown and the one-note brilliance of the 'Wacky Characters'. This strong character voice consistently sets a tone of chaotic, absurd comedy. While much of the dialogue sacrifices strict naturalism for theatrical exaggeration (e.g., the FA's intercom breakdown, some of the 'Wacky Characters' lines), this choice is clearly intentional and successful in highlighting the script's theme of 'High Anxiety'. The dialogue functions very well to advance the simple plot of the turbulent flight and to reveal core character traits. There is some subtext, particularly in Mike's internal commentary and CL's shift from panic to gratitude, but the script generally favors direct and humorous expression over subtle underlying emotions, which suits its comedic intent.",

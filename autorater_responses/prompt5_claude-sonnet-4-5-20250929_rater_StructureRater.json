  "score": 6.8,
  "justification": "The script effectively hooks the audience with immediate chaos and builds comedic tension through escalating character absurdity, but its climax is more an explosion of character than a plot turning point, and the resolution is abruptly absent, leaving the narrative arc unfulfilled."

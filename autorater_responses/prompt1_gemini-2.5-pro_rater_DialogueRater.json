  "justification": "The dialogue is exceptionally strong in establishing distinct character voices; Anna\u2019s architectural precision ('mahogany', 'joinery', 'systematically') contrasts perfectly with Leo\u2019s whimsical, romanticized outlook. The naturalism is high, particularly in the sibling banter and the grounded, pragmatic details like the 'two-hour parking zone.' While the subtext is occasionally a bit overt\u2014specifically in lines that explicitly state the theme of 'triaging a life'\u2014the dialogue functions perfectly to advance the plot and reveal the core conflict between logic and emotion. The rhythm of the exchange feels polished and theatrical.",

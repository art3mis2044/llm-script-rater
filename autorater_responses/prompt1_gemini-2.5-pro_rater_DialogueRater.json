  "justification": "The dialogue in 'The Last Box' is highly effective across all criteria. It consistently sounds like real people interacting, particularly showcasing a believable sibling dynamic with a mix of exasperation, humor, and underlying affection. Anna's pragmatic, systematic voice is clearly distinct from Leo's more whimsical, narrative-driven one, and these voices remain consistent throughout the scene. There's excellent subtext, especially in their differing approaches to the grandmother's belongings; Anna's desire for order and preservation hints at her way of processing grief, while Leo's impulsiveness and focus on 'story' suggests a longing for continued connection and adventure. Functionally, the dialogue successfully introduces the central conflict (the locked box), deepens our understanding of both characters and their relationship, and establishes a warm, engaging tone that blends task-oriented realism with a sense of mystery and legacy. The resolution of their conflict through a compromise feels earned and satisfying.",

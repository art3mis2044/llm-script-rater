  "justification": "The script does an excellent job of establishing six distinct character voices within a very short timeframe, using archetypal traits to make each teenager immediately recognizable. The dialogue is functional, moving the plot from the introduction of the conflict to the climax and resolution efficiently. However, the dialogue lacks naturalism and subtext; it feels very much like a sitcom or a 'Disney Channel' sketch where characters state exactly how they feel and who they are ('I'm the anxious planner,' 'I'm the influencer'). The humor relies on tropes (like the middle-name trope) rather than organic interaction, and the lack of subtext makes the stakes feel low despite the 'nightmare' situation.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is highly effective at establishing six distinct character voices through specific vocabularies and verbal tics (e.g., Marcus's military jargon, Sam's true crime terminology, and Brittany's brand-focused whining). The comedic tone is consistent, and the dialogue serves its function well by rapidly establishing the stakes and moving the plot to its climax. However, the dialogue lacks subtext, as characters frequently state their internal emotions and archetypal traits directly ('I\u2019m the muscle of this group', 'I have a nervous bladder'). While appropriate for a broad comedy, the reliance on tropes and 'on-the-nose' descriptions slightly limits the naturalism of the piece.",

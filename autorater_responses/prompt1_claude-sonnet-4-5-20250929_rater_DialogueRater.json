  "justification": "The dialogue is highly effective in establishing distinct character voices; Anna\u2019s use of technical terms like 'dovetail joints' and 'integrity of the piece' contrasts well with Leo\u2019s more colloquial, impatient tone. The naturalism of their sibling dynamic is strong, particularly in the banter about their shared childhood. Subtext is present in their differing philosophies on 'value' and 'preservation,' hinting at deeper personality conflicts beyond the box itself. While the resolution regarding the cipher and hidden key feels a bit convenient and rushed, the dialogue successfully advances the plot and maintains a consistent tone throughout.",

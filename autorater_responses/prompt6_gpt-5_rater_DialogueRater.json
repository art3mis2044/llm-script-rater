  "justification": "The dialogue is highly effective in establishing six distinct and consistent character voices within a very short timeframe; the 'influencer,' the 'existentialist,' and the 'planner' are particularly well-defined through their specific vocabularies. The script excels in 'Function,' as the dialogue efficiently moves the plot through several comedic beats (the raccoon, the skunk, the parents) while maintaining a consistent tone. While it sacrifices some naturalism for stylized, sitcom-esque 'teen-speak' and lacks deep subtext, these choices serve the comedic genre well and ensure the humor lands effectively.",

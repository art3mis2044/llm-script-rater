  "justification": "The dialogue in 'In Tents' is exceptionally strong, particularly in its character voice and functional execution. Each of the six teens has a truly distinct and consistent way of speaking, making them instantly recognizable and adding layers of humor and personality. Ava's planner mentality, Noah's anxiety, Zoe's social media obsession, Ethan's practicality, Marco's puns, and Lena's dry cynicism all shine through their individual lines. The dialogue feels highly natural for a group of modern teenagers, capturing their slang, concerns, and reactions in a believable way, even when heightened for comedic effect. Subtext is well-handled, hinting at their underlying desire for independence, their fears of failure, and the general awkwardness of adolescence without needing to state these directly. Functionally, the dialogue excels: it drives the plot forward with each comedic mishap, reveals character through their unique responses, and perfectly establishes a light, chaotic, and genuinely funny tone throughout the play. The pacing of the dialogue, especially the rapid-fire exchanges and escalating whispers, also contributes significantly to the comedic rhythm.",

  "justification": "The script does an excellent job of establishing distinct character voices within a very short timeframe; each of the six teenagers has a clear, consistent personality that is reflected in their dialogue. The dialogue functions well to advance the plot and hit all the specific requirements of the prompt. However, the dialogue lacks subtext, as characters tend to state their emotions and the situation directly ('I knew this was a bad idea!', 'This is the nightmare!'). While the tone is appropriately comedic and theatrical, the naturalism is slightly hindered by somewhat stereotypical 'teen movie' phrasing.",

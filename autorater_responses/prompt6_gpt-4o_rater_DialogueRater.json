  "justification": "The dialogue in 'The Great Getaway' is highly effective in establishing distinct character voices and driving the plot forward with a clear, comedic tone. Each character's dialogue consistently reflects their defined personality: Zoey's adventurous defiance, Jenna's anxious worrying, Ryan's playful humor, Logan's exaggerated fear, Marcus's logical but flustered planning, and Lila's calm peacemaking. This strong character differentiation makes the interactions engaging and believable for a group of teenagers. Naturalism is generally good, especially for the comedic context, with lines that sound authentic even if slightly heightened for effect (e.g., Logan's fear of raccoons). The dialogue functions exceptionally well to advance the plot, moving from the initial setup to various escalating 'scares' and ultimately the comical apprehension by the parents. It also successfully establishes a lighthearted, rebellious, and fun tone. While subtext is present in hints of underlying anxieties or desires (e.g., Jenna's frequent 'water the trees,' Zoey's deep-seated need for freedom), it is not the primary focus, as characters tend to express their core motivations and emotions quite directly through their characteristic speech patterns. For a short, comedic piece, this level of subtext is sufficient, but a higher score would require more layers of unspoken meaning. Overall, it's a well-crafted and functional script for its intended purpose.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes a heightened, comedic tone and gives the two fathers distinct, albeit archetypal, voices that highlight their specific obsessions. It successfully fulfills its function by moving the plot from conflict to resolution quickly. However, it lacks naturalism and subtext, as characters frequently state their feelings and motivations directly, and the teenage characters sound somewhat like generic rom-com tropes rather than unique individuals.",

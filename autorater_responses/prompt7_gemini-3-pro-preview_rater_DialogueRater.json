  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional and establishes distinct character archetypes immediately. Julian\u2019s frantic, jargon-heavy speech contrasts sharply with Maria\u2019s calm, cryptic observations, creating a clear social hierarchy that collapses during the crisis. The subtext is strongest in the final beat with Maria\u2019s line, 'I missed a spot,' which suggests a level of intentionality or tragic irony regarding Dax\u2019s fate. However, the dialogue leans heavily into theatrical tropes; some lines, particularly the exposition between Dax and Lena and Julian\u2019s 'net worth' comment, feel a bit 'on-the-nose' rather than truly naturalistic. The shift to silence and whispers at the end is a powerful use of dialogue (and its absence) to establish the required ambiguous, sad tone.",

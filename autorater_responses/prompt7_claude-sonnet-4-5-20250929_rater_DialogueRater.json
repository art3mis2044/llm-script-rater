  "justification": "The script effectively fulfills the structural requirements of the prompt, creating a clear sense of urgency and emotional stakes. However, the dialogue is frequently 'on-the-nose,' with characters explicitly stating their history and motivations (e.g., 'For six years?' and 'I have your mother's research') in a way that feels slightly unnatural during a life-threatening disaster. While the characters are distinct, their voices are defined more by their professions and roles in the plot than by unique linguistic patterns. The subtext is thin, as the emotional conflict is mostly addressed through direct accusations and explanations. Nevertheless, the dialogue functions well to advance the plot and establish a somber, cinematic tone.",

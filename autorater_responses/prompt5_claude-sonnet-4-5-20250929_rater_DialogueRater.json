  "justification": "The dialogue in 'TURBULENCE AND TEARS' is exceptionally strong in establishing distinct and consistent character voices. Each character, from the 'good vibes' guitarist to the constantly complaining passenger and the unhinged flight attendant, speaks with a unique and memorable cadence, instantly revealing their persona. This strong characterization is highly functional, effectively driving the chaotic comedic tone and rapidly advancing the 'plot' of escalating absurdity within the confined setting. While the dialogue leans heavily into caricature and direct expression, which reduces traditional 'subtext,' this choice serves the script's specific brand of fast-paced, on-the-nose humor. The naturalism, while not aiming for gritty realism, is nevertheless authentic to the exaggerated personalities portrayed, making their reactions believable within the comedic framework.",

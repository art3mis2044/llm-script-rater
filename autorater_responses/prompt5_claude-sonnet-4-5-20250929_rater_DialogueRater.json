  "justification": "The script functions well as a fast-paced comedic sketch, successfully managing a large cast and giving each character a distinct, albeit stereotypical, voice. However, it suffers from a complete lack of subtext\u2014characters state their internal states and backstories directly to the audience or each other. Naturalism is sacrificed for hyperbole, which fits the 'chaos' prompt but makes the dialogue feel 'stagy' rather than grounded. The fourth-wall break at the end is functional for the genre but acts as a shortcut to establish the protagonist's perspective rather than revealing it through nuanced interaction.",

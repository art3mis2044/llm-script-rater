  "justification": "The script effectively uses dialogue to establish character archetypes quickly, such as the high-strung businessman and the protective mother. It successfully fulfills the structural requirements of the prompt, creating a clear sense of separation and emotional weight. However, the dialogue often lacks subtext; the characters state their internal conflicts very explicitly (e.g., 'It\u2019s not like my opinion matters' and 'clinging to the prescribed route'). Additionally, some lines during the disaster feel overly expository and composed for the situation, particularly Leo\u2019s sudden tactical analysis of the maintenance shafts and air pressure, which slightly undermines the naturalism of a high-panic event.",

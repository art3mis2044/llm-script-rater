  "justification": "The dialogue is punchy and successfully establishes a frantic comedic tone, with distinct voices for each family member that align with established sitcom archetypes. The script excels in function, as the dialogue efficiently drives the escalating chaos and physical comedy. However, the dialogue lacks subtext, with characters stating their motivations and feelings very directly. While the naturalism is appropriate for a high-energy comedy, it relies heavily on tropes (the dramatic teen, the sarcastic dad, the imaginative child), which prevents the voices from feeling truly unique or nuanced.",

  "justification": "The dialogue effectively establishes character archetypes and drives the plot toward its ambiguous conclusion, satisfying the structural requirements of the prompt. However, it lacks naturalism; in a life-or-death emergency like an approaching tornado, characters are unlikely to speak in the polished, poetic metaphors found here (e.g., 'Some of us are storms...'). These lines feel 'written' rather than spoken, pulling the reader out of the urgency of the scene. While the voices are distinct, they lean heavily on tropes (the cold professional, the wise elder), and the subtext is often sacrificed for direct emotional exposition.",

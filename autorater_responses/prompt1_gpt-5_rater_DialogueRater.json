  "justification": "The dialogue is highly effective at establishing character voice and driving the narrative. Anna\u2019s speech is clipped and technical, reflecting her pragmatism, while Leo\u2019s is metaphorical and playful, creating a sharp contrast that feels natural for siblings. The dialogue serves its function perfectly, turning a simple task into an emotional arc. However, the subtext becomes quite overt in the final third, particularly with the grandmother's letter, which explicitly explains the characters' personality flaws to them, moving from subtle implication to direct exposition.",

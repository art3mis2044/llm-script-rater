  "justification": "The dialogue in this script is exceptionally strong, earning high marks across all criteria. The naturalistic banter between Anna and Leo feels authentic, capturing the complex dynamic of siblings with their blend of exasperation, affection, and shared history. Each character possesses a distinct and consistent voice: Anna's practical, organized, and slightly guarded demeanor contrasts beautifully with Leo's whimsical, philosophical, and emotionally expressive nature. This contrast is a driving force of their interaction, making their dialogue consistently engaging. The script masterfully employs subtext, hinting at underlying grief, different coping mechanisms, and unspoken love through their playful jabs and profound moments of connection. The grandmother's letter, in particular, deftly addresses these hidden currents, revealing the deep understanding she had of their relationship. Functionally, the dialogue is highly effective; it not only propels the narrative forward as they search for the key and uncover memories but also deeply reveals their individual characters and their evolving relationship. The tone is perfectly balanced between poignant reflection and lighthearted humor, culminating in a deeply satisfying emotional resolution. The dialogue is a significant strength of this script, creating rich characters and a compelling emotional journey.",

  "justification": "The dialogue in this script is exceptionally well-crafted, earning high marks across all criteria. Naturalism shines through in the believable, witty banter between Anna and Leo; their exchanges feel authentic to a real sibling dynamic. Each character possesses a distinct and consistent voice: Anna's practical, systematic approach contrasts beautifully with Leo's whimsical, easily distracted, yet deeply sentimental nature. This contrast isn't merely for laughs but reveals significant subtext about their individual coping mechanisms and their relationship with their grandmother's memory. The grandmother's letter masterfully draws out and addresses these underlying dynamics, offering a poignant layer of understanding. Functionally, the dialogue is superb, propelling the plot forward with the search for the key, revealing deep character traits, and establishing a tone that is both humorous and profoundly moving. The progression from playful bickering to a shared emotional discovery and reconciliation is handled with remarkable skill, making every line contribute meaningfully to the overall narrative and character development.",

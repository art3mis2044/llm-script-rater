  "justification": "The dialogue in this script is exceptionally well-crafted, excelling across all criteria. It achieves a high degree of naturalism, with exchanges that sound authentic to a real-life sibling dynamic, full of believable banter, shared history, and nuanced emotional responses. Each character has a distinct and consistent voice: Anna is practical, methodical, and slightly reserved, while Leo is impulsive, imaginative, and uses humor as a coping mechanism, yet both reveal their underlying affection and vulnerability. The script is rich in subtext, with the characters' contrasting approaches to opening the box and their recollections of their grandmother hinting at deeper emotional landscapes and their individual ways of processing grief and connection. Functionally, the dialogue is highly effective; it propels the plot forward with the mystery of the box, subtly reveals layers of character and their relationship, and masterfully establishes a tone that shifts from lighthearted to nostalgic to genuinely moving. The grandmother's 'voice' through her hidden messages and their shared memories is particularly strong, culminating in a poignant and resonant resolution for both characters and the audience.",

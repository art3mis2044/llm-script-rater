  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional, moving the plot from conflict to resolution with clarity, but it lacks depth and distinction. The voices of Judd and Jagger are virtually indistinguishable, as are those of Maya and Connor. There is a total absence of subtext, with characters explicitly stating their motivations and feelings (e.g., 'This is WAR' and 'We just care about the environment'). While it fits a broad, sitcom-style tone, the naturalism is low due to the exaggerated, trope-heavy exchanges and the immediate, convenient resolution of the long-standing rivalry.",

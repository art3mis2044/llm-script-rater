{
  "justification": "The dialogue successfully establishes distinct voices for each family member, using specific vocabularies like Anna's military metaphors and Chloe's Gen-Z slang to differentiate them. It functions well to build the frantic pace required by the scene's prompt. However, it relies heavily on tropes and lacks subtext, as characters frequently state their internal states and the situation's stakes directly ('My social life is over', 'We don\u2019t have time for emotional support breakfast!'). While the naturalism is a bit heightened for comedic effect, it remains consistent within the established tone.",

  "justification": "The dialogue in 'FLIGHT 447' is intentionally farcical and over-the-top, excelling at establishing a chaotic, comedic tone. Each character is given an extremely distinct and consistent voice, making them immediately recognizable caricatures of their archetypes. The dialogue effectively introduces these characters and advances the plot's central premise of Mike's descent into madness amidst the chaos. However, these strengths come at a significant cost to naturalism; the dialogue is explicitly unrealistic and not how real people would speak in this situation. Subtext is also almost entirely absent, with characters explicitly stating their emotions, beliefs, and motivations directly to the audience or other characters. While these choices are deliberate for the script's chosen genre (farce), they directly contradict the criteria of naturalism and subtext.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is heavily reliant on exaggerated tropes and clich\u00e9s, which severely limits its naturalism and subtext. Each character speaks in a one-dimensional manner that matches their label (e.g., the businessman shouting 'SELL! SELL! SELL!' and the rapper saying 'Yo, yo, yo'), making the voices distinct but lacks any depth or realism. There is zero subtext, as every character explicitly states their internal state and motivations. While the dialogue successfully fulfills the prompt's requirements and establishes a chaotic, farcical tone, it functions more like a series of disconnected gags than a cohesive theatrical scene.",

  "justification": "The dialogue is highly functional and establishes distinct character voices immediately, effectively contrasting the 'traditional' and 'wild card' grandmothers. The pacing is brisk, and the dialogue serves the comedic tone well. However, it lacks subtext; the characters state their emotions and motivations explicitly (e.g., 'I\u2019m on a hot streak,' 'I had a dark moment'). The naturalism is slightly hampered by its reliance on sitcom-style tropes and clich\u00e9s, such as the 'Winner, winner, chicken dinner' punchline, which feels predictable rather than organic.",

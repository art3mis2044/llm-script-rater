Write a short theatrical scene (1-2 pages) with as many characters as you want, but you must include the following:
        1. A 16 year-old boy
        2. A 16 year-old girl
        3. A dad who loves to cook hotdogs named Judd
        4. Another dad who loves to cook hamburgers names Jagger

    Setting: A barbecue at a park

    Situation: Jagger and Judd have been enemies since before they could walk. In high school they were always competing over the best girl, the best car or the most strength. Now however, it's all about who can barbecue better. These two rivals decide to host a great barbecue cook-off to see who can do it better: hotdogs vs. hamburger. However, what they didn't see coming was Judd's 16 year-old daughter and Jagger's 16 year-old son falling in love in the process, along with some comedic mishaps of course.

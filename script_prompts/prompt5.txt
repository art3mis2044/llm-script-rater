Write a short theatrical scene (1-2 pages) with as many characters as you want, but you must include the following:
        1. A crazy lady who has a serious fear of flying
        2. A laid back guitarist
        3. The flight attendant who is going through a breakup and has a breakdown on the flight as well as explains the whole situation on the intercom.
        4. Must include 11 wacky character + Mike (the main character)

    Setting: Inside a flying plane.

    Situation: A flight to Florida ends up being one of the worst flights Mike has been on. He's just 17, coming home from visiting his grandma in California, however he ends up having to share a plane with people who drive him absolutely crazy. On top of that there's a baby crying, a flight attendant breaking down on the intercom because of a breakup, and too much turbulence. Will Mike make it out of this sane?

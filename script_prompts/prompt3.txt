Write a short theatrical scene (1-2 pages) with as many characters as you want, but you must include the following:
        1. A "main family" who is hosting the dinner
        2. A grandma who is very hip and snazzy and just came back from a trip to Vegas
        3. Another grandma who is very strict and sticks to tradition
        4. A pet chicken named Goose

    Setting: A Thanksgiving family dinner.

    Situation: It is the evening on Thanksgiving, and all the family is coming to the Brewer's house for dinner. Unfortunately, like most families, the extended family doesn't exactly get along. In between two grandmas who are polar opposites and hate each other with an undying passion, and a chicken who almost got cooked instead of the turkey, there is enough chaos to go around, and a load of comedy to go along with it.

Write a short theatrical scene (1-2 pages) with as many characters as you want, but you must include the following:
        1. Two people who are separated in some way at the end of the scene.
        2. The scene must end in ambiguity with a sad undertone.

    Setting: Some sort of drastic impeding external/environmental event or disaster

    Situation: Following a group of people (who come from different walks of life) as they go about their day, and end up at the same place at the same time. At this time, some sort of major environmental disaster or external drastic event happens that forces them to either band together or separate apart. This scene should have a dramatic ending, and explore emotional conflicts within some of the characters.

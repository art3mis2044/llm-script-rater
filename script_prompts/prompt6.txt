Write a short theatrical scene (1-2 pages) with as many characters as you want, but you must include the following:
        1. 6 teenagers: 3 girls, 3 boys
        2. Each teenager should have a unique distinct personality

    Setting: A camping ground with two tents. It should be nighttime.

    Situation: A group of 6 friends have been planning a senior trip for as long as they could remember. The problem: their parents won't let them go off on their own. However, the gang gets together and sneaks out to go on their dream camping trip. This camping trip is less a dream and more a nightmare, including someone who constantly needs to go pee, dangerous creatures outside, and way too little sleep. In the end, they all get busted by the parents. This skit must be comedic.

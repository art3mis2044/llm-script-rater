**Title:** THE ZERO LINE
**Characters:**

*   **JULIAN (40s):** A high-powered corporate lawyer. Dressed impeccably, glued to a tablet.
*   **MARIA (60s):** A custodian. Wearing blue coveralls, pushing a cleaning cart. Quiet, observant.
*   **DAX (20s):** A bike courier. Helmet under arm, sweaty, anxious.
*   **LENA (20s):** Dax’s partner. Carrying a violin case. Soft-spoken but firm.

**Setting:**
An elevated, open-air transit platform in a near-future metropolis. The skyline is visible but looks wrong—the sky is a bruised purple. In the distance, a massive, unnatural wall of dust (a "Geostorm") is approaching, swallowing skyscrapers whole.

[SCENE START]

**LIGHTS UP:**

The platform is sterile and white. The sound of distant, rhythmic thumping is audible—like a heartbeat in the sky.

JULIAN paces, tapping furiously on his tablet. MARIA is slowly mopping a single, stubborn stain near the edge of the platform. DAX and LENA stand near the tracks, tense.

JULIAN
(Into an earpiece)
I don’t care about force majeure clauses, David. Sell the shares. All of them. Look at the sky, you idiot—wait, are you crying? Stop crying and sell!

DAX
(To Lena)
I told you we should have taken the tunnels. The upper levels aren't safe when the sirens start.

LENA
(Gripping her violin case)
The tunnels are flooded, Dax. This is the last train out of the sector. It’ll be here.

MARIA stops mopping. She leans on her handle, looking not at the track, but at the horizon.

MARIA
It’s not a train coming, child.

DAX
(Snapping)
The board says "Arriving in 2 Minutes." It’s coming.

The THUMPING sound grows louder. The purple sky begins to darken rapidly. The wind picks up, blowing Maria’s cart across the stage. A mechanical SIREN blasts—a deafening, discordant horn.

**AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)**
*Atmospheric breach detected. Sector 7 lockdown initiated. Blast shields engaging in thirty seconds.*

JULIAN
(lowering the tablet)
Lockdown? No. No, I have clearance.
(He runs to a glass ticket booth, pounding on it)
Hey! Open the priority gate!

The wind becomes violent. Debris flies past.

MARIA
(Calmly)
Mr. Julian. You need to stand back from the edge. The air is turning sour.

JULIAN
(Ignoring her, frantic)
My net worth is in the cloud, and the cloud is literally on fire!

Suddenly, the ground shakes violently. The "train" arrives—but it’s an emergency evacuation pod, small and silver. It hisses open. It is clearly too small for everyone.

DAX
(Pulling Lena)
Go. Get in!

LENA
Not without you.

DAX
There’s two seats! We fit!

They rush toward the pod. JULIAN sees it. He scrambles over a turnstile, his expensive suit tearing.

JULIAN
That’s priority transport! I paid for Tier One access!

Julian shoves Dax hard. Dax slips on the wet floor Maria was mopping. Julian lunges for the pod, but MARIA steps in his path. She doesn't look like a custodian anymore; she looks like a stone wall. She holds up a master keycard.

MARIA
Tier One doesn't mean what you think it means anymore, sir.

She swipes the card on the pod's exterior panel. A red light turns green. She looks at Lena.

MARIA (CONT'D)
Take it.

LENA
(Freezing)
Dax, get up!

Dax scrambles to his feet, but the wind is howling now. The massive WALL OF DUST is visible just off-stage, darkening the lights. The "Blast Shields"—thick metal shutters—begin to descend from the ceiling, dividing the platform in half. The pod is on the *safe* side. The entrance is on the *exposed* side.

Julian, realizing he can't fight Maria, dives under the descending metal wall toward the pod. He makes it through.

Dax grabs Lena’s hand and pulls her toward the gap. The metal wall is dropping fast. Waist height. Knee height.

DAX
Slide! Go!

Lena slides under the door. She scrambles up on the other side, next to Julian (who is hyperventilating). She turns back, reaching her hand out under the closing gap.

LENA
Dax! Hand! Give me your hand!

Dax drops to his stomach. He reaches out. Their fingers brush.

The wind on Dax’s side is now a hurricane. It drags him backward, just an inch.

DAX
(Straining)
The floor... it’s too slick.

He looks at Maria. Maria is standing calmly amidst the chaos on the exposed side. She looks down at the spot she just mopped. She looks at Dax.

MARIA
(Softly)
I missed a spot.

The shutter crunches down, stopping six inches from the floor.

LENA
(Screaming through the gap)
DAX! CRAWL!

DAX
(Yelling over the wind)
I can’t get traction! The wind is—

**CLANG.**

The shutter slams completely shut. The seal hisses.

The sound of the wind instantly cuts out for Lena and Julian. It is dead silent on their side.

**LIGHTS SHIFT:**

On STAGE LEFT (The Exposed Side), the light turns a suffocating, dusty orange. Dax is huddled against the metal door, pounding on it weakly. Maria stands beside him, unmoving, watching the dust storm swallow the world. She places a hand on Dax’s shoulder. He buries his head in his knees.

On STAGE RIGHT (The Safe Side), the light is sterile, fluorescent blue. Julian is sitting on the floor, checking his tablet, which is now dead black.

Lena is on her knees, pressing her ear against the cold metal door. She waits for a sound. A knock. Anything.

She raises her hand and places her palm flat against the metal.

LENA
(A whisper)
Dax?

No answer.

Julian looks at Lena. He looks at the door. He opens his mouth to say something comforting, or perhaps something selfish, but decides against it. He just stares at the blank screen of his tablet.

Lena stays frozen, hand on the metal, as the lights on the Exposed Side slowly fade to black, leaving only the sound of the wind rising again, muffled and distant, like a memory.

**BLACKOUT.**

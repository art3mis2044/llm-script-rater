Setting: The Brewer family dining room. A long table is set with plates, candles, and an overly ambitious centerpiece shaped like a cornucopia. Evening on Thanksgiving. From the kitchen, the smell of turkey wafts. Somewhere in the house, a phone chirps with a flashy casino jingle.

[Lights up. Alice is arranging napkins. Tom is basting a turkey with too much enthusiasm. Maya scrolls on her phone. Ben sits on the floor near a small chicken-sized sweater labeled “GOOSE.” Goose, an actual chicken, struts proudly, pecking a cranberry off the centerpiece.]

Alice: Tom, no more basting. You’re drowning it.

Tom: They say moisture is flavor. I am ensuring a moist experience.

Maya: Dad, stop saying moist.

Ben: Goose likes moist. (He holds up the sweater.) I knit Goose a sweater for the annual hunger parade.

Maya: You mean “hangry family parade.”

Alice: Everyone, just breathe. They’ll be here any minute, and it’s fine. It’s Thanksgiving. It’s fine. (She looks at Goose.) Goose, please refrain from eating the decorative gourd.

(Goose pecks the decorative gourd. The doorbell rings. Tom drops the baster with a clatter.)

Tom: Showtime.

(Maya opens the door. Grandma Roxie sweeps in in sequins and a feathered stole, rolling a glittery suitcase. The phone chirps again with slot-machine bells.)

Grandma Roxie: Darlings! Your Vegas queen has landed! I brought everyone souvenir dice and a questionable keychain shaped like a cactus.

Alice: Roxie! Hi! What…what are you wearing?

Grandma Roxie: A limited edition “Extravaganza of Elegance” jacket. It glows under blacklight and judgment. Where’s my Goose?

(Goose saunters proudly toward her. She kneels and produces a tiny gold chain.)

Grandma Roxie: For you, my feathery influencer. Tag me later.

(Goose allows the chain around its neck, then flutters onto a chair.)

Tom: Mom, you were in Vegas for three days.

Grandma Roxie: Time is fake in Vegas, Tommy. I saw a magician marry a mime. Twice. Also, I won a turkey on a slot machine by accident. Which reminds me, I have thoughts about your centerpiece. It needs smoke. And a saxophone.

(A knock. Before anyone can move, the door opens with a groan. Grandma Edith enters, holding a stern-looking casserole and a thermos. She wears a sweater with an embroidered cornucopia and a no-nonsense expression.)

Grandma Edith: We knock and then we wait. That’s basic etiquette. Alice, your door was unlocked. You’ll get raccoons.

Alice: Hi, Mom. Happy Thanksgiving.

Grandma Edith: Happy Thanksgiving. I brought the green bean casserole and the good gravy. Store-bought gravy is a sin against tradition.

Grandma Roxie: So is boiled anything.

Grandma Edith: (Noticing Roxie) Oh. You’re…back. Did you bring glitter? Please keep the glitter away from the food.

Grandma Roxie: Did you bring your personality? Please keep it out of my champagne.

Uncle Nate: (Poking his head in behind Edith) We come in peace! We brought rolls. Priya brought a salad that looks like a garden.

Aunt Priya: It is a garden. We will return it after dinner. (She smiles, setting down a platter of jewel-toned vegetables.)

Alice: Wonderful. Everyone’s here. We can… (She claps her hands.) We can sit.

(They begin to sit. Goose leaps onto a chair, then onto the table. Edith gasps. Goose stares down the turkey like an opponent.)

Grandma Edith: Alice. Why is there poultry on the table wearing jewelry?

Maya: He’s family.

Ben: He’s Goose.

Grandma Edith: The goose? You cooked a goose this year?

Tom: No-one cooked anyone—no one cooked Goose. No, that’s—

Grandma Roxie: Goose is a chicken, Edith. The name is a choice. Like fun. And eye shadow.

Grandma Edith: Chickens belong outside. Not inside. Not at the table. Not as…guests.

Grandma Roxie: At the Flamingo, they let birds gamble. This one could probably win at craps.

Goose: (Clucks.)

Alice: Maybe let’s say grace first?

Grandma Edith: Finally. In this family we say grace before gossip.

Grandma Roxie: I prefer grace after the second martini, but I’ll try anything once.

(Everyone takes hands; Goose pecks at a napkin ring. Ben grabs Goose’s wing as if to include him in the circle; Goose tolerates it. Edith eyes the chain around Goose’s neck.)

Grandma Edith: (Eyes closed.) Lord, we give thanks for gathered kin, for the great bounty, for—

Grandma Roxie: And for slot machines with forgiving jackpots—

Grandma Edith: For bounty, and for patience in the face of—

Grandma Roxie: —and for the handsome Elvis impersonator—

Grandma Edith: —adversity.

Grandma Roxie: Amen to that. And to handsome.

Tom: Amen. Great! Turkey time.

Alice: (Standing, smiling too brightly) Before we carve, a small note about…a misunderstanding.

(Maya and Ben exchange looks. Tom beams, oblivious.)

Tom: Oh, the brine. Guys, you are going to love this brine. Apple cider, cinnamon sticks, a whisper of bourbon. I labeled the cooler—didn’t want to confuse anything—so I wrote “GOOSE” on the lid. For Thanksgiving goose. Organization!

Alice: There was no goose.

Grandma Edith: There should be goose. Thanksgiving was once goose. Tradition.

Grandma Roxie: I have never been thankful for goose. It shrugs at seasoning.

Maya: Dad means he wrote “GOOSE” because Ben labels everything that belongs to Goose. The cooler…belongs to Goose. His feed is in there.

Ben: I wanted to put the sweater in there so it smelled like home.

Tom: Well, in my defense, the cooler fits a bird perfectly.

Uncle Nate: Uh-oh.

Aunt Priya: Is this the part where I reveal I brought vegan gravy?

Alice: Two hours ago, Tom put Goose… (She gestures vaguely upward, as if words can’t reach.) In the cooler.

Tom: I put a bird in a cooler for brining! The bird was…presently lively. It seemed…generous of spirit.

Grandma Edith: You attempted to brine the family pet?

Grandma Roxie: (Choking on laughter) Oh, baby. You tried to marinate an influencer.

Maya: I rescued him. He was floating, very indignant. He made a sound like a car alarm.

Ben: I said, “Don’t cook Goose!” But Dad thought I meant “Don’t cook the goose,” which is different.

Tom: Language is a tricky animal.

Grandma Edith: Or a chicken.

Goose: (Fluffs feathers, glowers at Tom, clucks firmly.)

Alice: We rinsed him. He’s fine. He smells faintly of bourbon and regret. We are not cooking Goose. The turkey is the turkey.

Grandma Edith: The turkey had better be traditional. No unusual spices, no…novelties.

Grandma Roxie: Oh, loosen your pearls. Put a little zest in your yams, Edith.

Grandma Edith: Zest goes in dessert, not in poultry. The wishbone must be saved and dried for three days before—

Grandma Roxie: The only wishbone I care about was in a strip show called “Birds of a Feather.” Stunning choreography.

(Uncle Nate pours water all around.)

Uncle Nate: Merry Grati… happy family! Who wants a roll?

(Alice reaches for the carving knife. Goose jumps closer, eyeing the blade. Maya distracts Goose with a cranberry. Tom puffs up, ready to carve.)

Tom: And now—

(He cuts into the turkey. It squeaks. The skin is glossy, but when the knife hits, it tears weirdly. He lifts a slice; it looks, somehow, both dry and also slick with too much baste.)

Tom: That’s…that’s not right.

Alice: (Whispering, tight) Because you basted it every three minutes, it steamed.

Grandma Edith: A turkey should be basted every thirty minutes. It says so in the Joy of Cooking. Page 478.

Grandma Roxie: In Vegas we spatchcock. Everything. It’s a lifestyle.

Aunt Priya: We could drown it in gravy. It’s a metaphor for family.

Grandma Edith: I made the good gravy.

Grandma Roxie: I brought a spicy gravy shot from the casino buffet chef. He owes me a favor.

Grandma Edith: If your gravy sparkles, I will leave.

Goose: (Pecks the ladle.)

Ben: Goose is hungry. And forgiving.

Maya: Who can blame him? He survived attempted sous-vide.

Tom: Look, we all made mistakes. Some of us labeled poorly. Some of us bathed a chicken in bourbon. We learn. We move on.

Grandma Edith: We uphold tradition. We sit. We eat. We say a nice thing about the yams. No more birds on chairs.

Grandma Roxie: I’ll make a deal. If Goose stops judging the turkey, I won’t Instagram him in a tuxedo collar.

Alice: (Sighing, then smiling) Okay. New tradition. Everyone says one thing they’re grateful for, and if anyone mentions Vegas, bourbon, or brining, you have to eat extra dry turkey.

Grandma Roxie: That’s barbaric.

Grandma Edith: That’s consequences.

Uncle Nate: I’ll go first. I’m grateful for…rolls.

Aunt Priya: I’m grateful for this family attempting, in its own way, to gather.

Maya: I’m grateful for Goose and the content we almost lost.

Ben: I’m grateful Goose forgave Dad. Right, Goose?

Goose: (Clucks. Pats Tom’s sleeve with a wing. Kinda.)

Tom: I’m grateful for rescue operations. And for labels. And for moisture.

Maya: Dad.

Tom: Hydration. I’m grateful for hydration.

Grandma Edith: I’m grateful for recipes written down, index cards, and the dignity of the dining room.

Grandma Roxie: I’m grateful for glitter, sequins, and being alive enough to annoy Edith.

Grandma Edith: The feeling is mutual.

Grandma Roxie: Cheers to the duel that keeps us young.

Alice: I’m grateful for…this chaos. For the fact that somehow, in the noise, we know we’ll still show up next year. And I’m grateful that the turkey is at least…edible.

(Goose, sensing a lull, jumps onto the table, struts to the turkey. Everyone gasps. Goose pecks the turkey, then the gravy boat, which teeters ominously toward Edith.)

Grandma Edith: No—!

(Too late. Sploosh. Gravy pours across the tablecloth into Edith’s lap. She freezes. Everyone else freezes. Silence. Then Edith blinks.)

Grandma Edith: It is…warm.

Grandma Roxie: It’s tradition. The gravy must bless the matriarch. Page 479.

(A beat. Edith looks at Goose. Goose holds her gaze and clucks softly, contrite.)

Grandma Edith: Well. Accidents happen. Someone get me a towel. And for Heaven’s sake, save the gravy.

(A sigh of relief moves the room. Alice tosses towels. Laughter bubbles up shyly, then fully.)

Alice: Okay. Pass the rolls. Priya, pass the garden. Nate, stop hiding under the table. Tom, carve with confidence.

Tom: With humility. And gratitude.

Maya: And a new label maker for Christmas.

Ben: And a smaller sweater for Goose. He’s bulking up.

Grandma Roxie: Next year we do it in Vegas.

Grandma Edith: Over my pilgrim body.

(They dig in. Goose settles on a chair, satisfied, wearing his tiny gold chain and a napkin tied like a cape. The family passes dishes, still bickering, already forgiving. The slot-machine jingle goes off one more time; Roxie silences it with a wink to Goose.)

Lights down.

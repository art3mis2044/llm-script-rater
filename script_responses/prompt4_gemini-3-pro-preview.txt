**Title:** THE GRILL OF IT ALL
**Setting:** A sunny public park. Two massive, expensive grills are set up directly facing each other, about ten feet apart. It looks like a duel. Smoke billows from both.
**Characters:**
*   **JUDD (40s):** Wears an apron that looks like a giant mustard packet. Intense. Loves hotdogs.
*   **JAGGER (40s):** Wears a chef’s hat and an apron that says “LICENSE TO GRILL.” Competitive. Loves hamburgers.
*   **CHLOE (16):** Judd’s daughter. Smart, slightly embarrassed, holding a plate of potato salad.
*   **LIAM (16):** Jagger’s son. Wearing sunglasses, trying to look cool despite the chaos. holding a bag of buns.

[SCENE START]

**LIGHTS UP:**

(JUDD and JAGGER are locked in a stare-down. Both are wielding tongs like swords. The air is filled with smoke.)

**JUDD**
You’re crowding my smoke zone, Jagger. The casing on a frankfurter needs room to breathe. It needs *feng shui*.

**JAGGER**
(Scoffs)
Feng shui? Please. A burger doesn’t need interior design, Judd. It needs heat, aggression, and one hundred percent steer. You’re cooking mystery meat in a tube. I’m sculpting art.

**JUDD**
(Aggressively flips a hotdog)
It’s not mystery meat! It’s an emulsified sausage of high-quality pork trimmings! And it’s about the *snap*. If it doesn’t snap, it’s crap!

**JAGGER**
(Aggressively flips a burger)
Rhyming won’t save you when the judges taste this char.

(Cut to a wooden picnic table five feet away. CHLOE and LIAM sit side-by-side. They are ostensibly setting up condiments, but their hands are lingering near each other near the relish jar.)

**CHLOE**
(Whispering)
Do you think they remember we’re here?

**LIAM**
(Whispering back)
My dad has been marinating that ground chuck since Tuesday. I’m pretty sure he forgot *he’s* here. He’s in the "Meat Zone."

**CHLOE**
(Giggles)
My dad woke me up at 5:00 AM to discuss "bun integrity."

**LIAM**
(Smiling, charming)
Well... for what it's worth, I’m glad he did. Otherwise, I’d be stuck watching Netflix alone while my dad yells at raw beef.

**CHLOE**
(Blushing)
Me too. Even if the smell of charcoal is permanently stuck in my hair.

**LIAM**
It’s a good look on you. Eau de Barbecue.

(They lean in closer. It’s a sweet moment. Suddenly—)

**JAGGER**
(Yelling)
LIAM! The Brioche! We are at T-Minus two minutes to plating!

**JUDD**
(Yelling)
CHLOE! The pretzel buns! The integrity is at stake!

(The teens jump apart. Liam grabs the bag of buns. Chloe grabs a basket.)

**LIAM**
(Sotto voce to Chloe)
Meet me by the swing set in ten? I smuggled some veggie skewers. No meat involved.

**CHLOE**
(Grinning)
It’s a date.

(They rush to their respective fathers. The dads are now in a frenzy.)

**JAGGER**
(Sweating profusely)
Liam, hand me the spatula! The Big Boy Spatula! This patty is a monster!

**JUDD**
Chloe, tongs! No, the *precision* tongs! I need to rotate the dogs thirty degrees!

(JAGGER attempts a flair move—tossing the burger in the air to catch it on the bun. He overestimates his own agility.)

**JAGGER**
Witness the "Jagger Flip!"

(The burger flies into the air. It misses the bun completely and lands with a wet *SPLAT* right into JUDD’S open container of expensive sauerkraut.)

**JUDD**
(Horrified)
My kraut! My artisanal, Bavarian-style kraut! You’ve contaminated the ecosystem!

**JAGGER**
(Defensive)
It was a wind gust! A rogue thermal updraft!

**JUDD**
That is it! Chemical warfare!

(JUDD squeezes a giant yellow mustard bottle aggressively. The cap pops off. A massive geyser of yellow mustard explodes outward, missing Jagger entirely and hitting LIAM square in the chest.)

**LIAM**
(Freezing)
Oh. Okay.

**CHLOE**
(Gasps, trying not to laugh)
Liam!

**JAGGER**
(Gasping)
You mustard-ed my heir! You yellow-bellied condiment sprayer!

**JUDD**
(Looking at Liam)
It... it brings out his eyes?

(Liam looks down at his ruined shirt, then at Chloe. Chloe grabs a napkin and steps forward, ignoring her father.)

**CHLOE**
Here. Let me get that.

(She starts wiping the mustard off Liam’s shirt. She’s standing very close. The Dads stop shouting. They look at the sauerkraut-burger. They look at the mustard bottle. Then, slowly, they look at their children.)

**JAGGER**
Judd...

**JUDD**
Yeah, Jagger?

**JAGGER**
Is your daughter... cleaning my son?

**JUDD**
It appears so. And is your son... looking at my daughter like she’s a perfectly grilled frankfurter?

**JAGGER**
(Squinting)
I think he’s looking at her like she’s a medium-rare slider with swiss.

**LIAM**
(Without looking up)
Dad, Judd... can you guys give us a minute? We’re having a moment. And I smell like a ballpark.

**CHLOE**
(Smiling at Liam)
A cute ballpark.

(Judd and Jagger look at each other. The decades of rivalry simmer in the air.)

**JUDD**
(Sighs)
Well. The kraut is ruined.

**JAGGER**
(Grudgingly)
And that was my best patty.

**JUDD**
You want a hotdog? I have an extra.

**JAGGER**
...Does it have cheese inside it?

**JUDD**
Obviously. I’m not an amateur.

**JAGGER**
(Pause)
Fine. But I’m cooking the burgers for the wedding.

**JUDD**
In your dreams, hamburger man. In your dreams.

(Judd hands Jagger a hotdog. They lean against their grills, watching their kids laugh as Chloe wipes mustard off Liam’s chin.)

**BLACKOUT.**

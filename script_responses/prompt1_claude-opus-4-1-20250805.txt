**THE ATTIC**

*A dusty, cluttered attic filled with decades of accumulated memories. Cardboard boxes stack precariously against slanted walls. Afternoon light filters through a small window, catching dust motes in the air. ANNA, dressed in practical jeans and a button-down shirt, methodically sorts items into labeled boxes. LEO, wearing a vintage band t-shirt and paint-splattered jeans, rummages enthusiastically through a trunk.*

**LEO:** *(pulling out a feather boa)* Oh my God, look at this! Grandma was secretly fabulous!

**ANNA:** *(not looking up)* That's from her community theater days. Box three—donations.

**LEO:** Are you kidding? This is vintage! *(drapes it around his neck)* I'm keeping it.

**ANNA:** We agreed. Keep, donate, trash. No "Leo's treasure trove" category.

**LEO:** You agreed. I nodded while thinking about lunch. *(gasps, pulling out an ornate wooden box)* Anna. Anna, look at this.

**ANNA:** *(finally looking)* What is—oh. That's beautiful.

*LEO shakes the box. Something rattles inside. He tries to open it—locked.*

**LEO:** It's locked! There's something inside! This is it—this is where she kept the family fortune!

**ANNA:** Or her dentures. Put it in the "deal with later" pile.

**LEO:** Later? Anna, we're literally holding mystery! Adventure! Possibly dentures, but still! *(examining the lock)* I bet I could pop this open with a screwdriver—

**ANNA:** Absolutely not. That's mahogany with mother-of-pearl inlay. It's probably worth more than your car.

**LEO:** My car is worth negative dollars. I owe it an apology every time I turn the key.

**ANNA:** We need to find the actual key. It's the responsible thing—

**LEO:** *(mimicking her)* "It's the responsible thing." When has that ever led to anything interesting? Remember when you made us wait for the crosswalk signal at 3 AM with no cars for miles?

**ANNA:** The law doesn't have business hours, Leo.

**LEO:** *(holding the box up to the light)* What if this contains her diary? Love letters? The real reason Grandpa's brother moved to Argentina?

**ANNA:** Uncle Eduardo moved for the wine industry.

**LEO:** That's what they wanted us to think. *(shaking the box again)* Come on, one little crack. The lock's already loose—

**ANNA:** *(reaching for it)* Give it to me.

**LEO:** *(holding it away)* You'll put it in a spreadsheet somewhere and forget about it.

**ANNA:** I don't put things in spreadsheets, I—*(catches herself)* —okay, I have one spreadsheet. For the estate items.

**LEO:** With subcategories. And color coding.

**ANNA:** Organization is not a character flaw! 

*They both hold the box, engaged in a gentle tug-of-war.*

**LEO:** What if there's something in here she wanted us to find? What if we're supposed to open it?

**ANNA:** *(softening slightly)* What if there's something in there she didn't want anyone to find?

*They both look at the box, then at each other.*

**LEO:** That's... actually a good point.

**ANNA:** I know.

**LEO:** But now I want to open it even more.

**ANNA:** I know that too.

*Beat. The box sits between them, its secret intact.*

**LEO:** Rock, paper, scissors?

**ANNA:** *(sighing)* Best two out of three.

**LEO:** *(grinning)* See? You're fun. You just hide it under all that responsibility.

**ANNA:** And you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached. Ready?

*They position their hands.*

**BOTH:** Rock, paper, scissors, shoot—

*Lights fade as they throw their hands, the box gleaming between them in the dim light.*

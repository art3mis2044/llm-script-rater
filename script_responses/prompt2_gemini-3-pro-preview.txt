**TITLE: THE SMOOTHIE OPERATOR**

**CHARACTERS:**

*   **SARAH (40s):** Dressed in a sharp blazer from the waist up, pajama pants from the waist down. Holding a hairbrush like a weapon.
*   **MARK (40s):** Wearing a tie that is not tied. He is overly optimistic about his time management skills.
*   **LEO (10):** Wearing one shoe. Holding a papier-mâché volcano that looks dangerously damp.
*   **MIA (6):** Wearing a superhero cape and swim goggles. Refuses to touch the floor because it is "lava."
*   **BARKLEY:** A Golden Retriever with zero survival instincts and a high food drive.

**SETTING:**
A standard middle-class kitchen. It is currently a war zone of cereal boxes, open backpacks, and unsigned permission slips.

**TIME:**
Wednesday. 7:42 AM. The bus comes at 7:45 AM.

[SCENE START]

**LIGHTS UP:**

The kitchen is in chaos. A radio is blaring traffic news. BARKLEY is barking at the toaster.

SARAH is frantically brushing MIA’S hair while MIA stands on a chair. MARK is aggressively chopping fruit near a blender.

SARAH
(Checking her watch)
Three minutes! We have three minutes until the bus driver decides he hates us again. Leo, where is your left shoe?

LEO
(Staring at the fridge)
It’s been missing since Tuesday. I think Barkley ate it.

MARK
(Cheerfully)
Barkley eats fiber, Leo, not rubber. Everyone relax. I am making the Power-Start Wednesday Smoothie. It’s got kale, protein powder, and... where’s the peanut butter?

SARAH
Mark, we don’t have time for the Power-Start! We have time for a Pop-Tart and a prayer! Mia, hold still or you’re going to school looking like a static electricity experiment.

MIA
(Screaming)
The floor is lava! If I get down, I’ll burn!

SARAH
If you don’t get down, you’ll be late, and that is a fate worse than death because I have a Zoom call at eight!

LEO
(Holding up the volcano)
Mom, the lava on my volcano isn't dry. It’s dripping.

SARAH
Why is it wet? You did this three days ago!

LEO
I wanted to make it shine so I put olive oil on it.

SARAH
(Stops brushing. Stares into the void.)
Olive oil. You basted your homework.

MARK
Found the peanut butter! It was in the bathroom. Don't ask.
(He dumps a massive glob into the blender)
Okay, troops! Vitamin time!

MARK hits the "PULSE" button. The blender emits a sound like a jet engine grinding gravel. BARKLEY starts howling.

SARAH
Mark! The permission slip! Did you sign the permission slip for the petting zoo?

MARK
(Yelling over the blender)
I thought you signed it!

SARAH
I was doing the taxes! Where is it?

LEO
I think it’s under the volcano.

Leo lifts the dripping volcano. The paper underneath is translucent with oil.

SARAH
Oh, fantastic. Now the goats will think you smell like a salad. Put it in the bag! Go!

MIA
(Jumping from the chair to the counter)
Parkour!

MARK
(To the blender)
Why aren't you blending? It’s stuck.
(He shakes the pitcher violently)
Just... mix... you... stubborn...

LEO
Mom, I can’t find the shoe!

SARAH
Wear the boots!

LEO
The snow boots? It’s seventy degrees!

SARAH
Then hop! I don’t care! Just get to the door!

MARK
almost there... just need to shove the kale down...

MARK takes the lid off the blender while the motor is still whirring down, then impulsively grabs a wooden spoon to poke the mixture. He hits the "HIGH" switch by accident.

**SPLAT.**

A geyser of green sludge explodes upward.

It hits the ceiling.
It hits the cabinets.
It hits MARK directly in the face.
A significant amount lands on the front of SARAH’S white blazer.

Silence descends. even the radio seems to stop.

MIA
(Awed)
Green lava.

SARAH looks down at her blazer. She slowly wipes a piece of kale off her lapel.

MARK
(Wiping green slime from his eyes)
...It’s mostly spinach. It washes out?

From outside, a loud, impatient HONK blasts through the air.

SARAH
(Deadly calm)
Bus.

LEO
(Grabbing his backpack)
Bye Mom! Bye Dad!

Leo hops on one foot out the door.

MIA
(Sliding off the counter)
Bye!

Mia sprints out, cape fluttering.

SARAH and MARK are left alone in the wreckage. BARKLEY slowly walks over to the puddle of green smoothie on the floor and begins to enthusiastically lap it up.

MARK
So. Do you want the Pop-Tart?

SARAH stares at him. She unbuttons the ruined blazer, drops it on the floor, and picks up her car keys.

SARAH
I’m taking the coffee. You’re cleaning the kitchen. And Mark?

MARK
Yes, honey?

SARAH
If you touch the blender again, I’m feeding you to the dog.

Sarah exits.

Mark sighs. He looks at Barkley.

MARK
It was a good recipe, Barkley. Just needed more liquidity.

Mark takes a bite of a dry Pop-Tart as the lights fade.

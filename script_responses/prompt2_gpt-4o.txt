**Title: Breakfast Brigade**

**Setting: A modest, middle-class kitchen. The space is lively and cluttered, with a small round table at the center surrounded by mismatched chairs, a counters crowded with dishes, and a couple of staunchly defiant stools. A clock on the wall reads 7:15 AM. A small, enthusiastic dog named Sparky and a disinterested cat named Whiskers roam the scene.**

**Characters:**
- **MOTHER (ANNE)**: Early 40s, practical, the linchpin of the family.
- **FATHER (TOM)**: Early 40s, easygoing but often scatterbrained.
- **SARAH**: 10, sharp-witted elder child, always ready with a quip.
- **JACK**: 7, the mischievous younger child, with energy for days.
- **SPARKY**: Rambunctious, friendly dog.
- **WHISKERS**: Aloof cat who enjoys surveying chaos from afar.

**Scene opens with a flurry of activity. Anne stands over the stove, flipping pancakes. Tom, with a tie half-done, rummages through cupboards for his travel mug. Sarah sits at the table, smartphone in hand, half-listening. Jack is under the table, giggling with Sparky. Whiskers rests regally on a window sill.**

**ANNE (frustrated yet amused):** Tom, have you seen Jack's sneakers?

**TOM (absently):** They were... by the plant in the living room, I think? Wait, why were they there?

**SARAH (eyes on her phone):** 'Cause Jack was hunting for treasure. Right, Jack?

**JACK (emerging from under the table, with a plastic tiara):** Arrr! The pirate king needed his shoes to find the hidden loot! 

**SPARKY (barks excitedly, tail wagging):** Woof!

**ANNE (shaking her head, flipping a pancake):** Well, unless you're planning to sail to school, I need you to wear those sneakers.

**TOM (scrambling with his tie):** Why is this thing suddenly impossible?

**WHISKERS (yawns from the windowsill):** Meow.

**SARAH (sarcastically):** Maybe Whiskers can give you lessons in elegance.

**JACK (points a finger dramatically):** Aye! Cap'n Sparky and I will seize the ship of breakfast! 

**SPARKY (leaps up energetically):** Woof, woof!

**ANNE (stifling a laugh):** Well, keep the ship afloat until Saturday, please.

**The microwave beeps, signifying the end of Tom's coffee adventure. He moves to retrieve it but forgets the mug again in his haste to get his shoes.**

**TOM (hastily):** Sarah, could you clear the table? 

**SARAH (not moving an inch, and scrolling):** mmm, working on it.

**ANNE (raising an eyebrow):** Sarah, eyes off your phone or your only connection will be with dirty dishes.

**SARAH (rolling her eyes, finally moving):** Okay, okay, work-life balance, got it.

**Jack gets up, wearing the still-missing sneakers on his hands like puppets, making them 'sing.'**

**JACK and SPARKY (together in a sing-song):** We're walkin' to school! On me big pirate shoes!

**TOM (missing the humor as he fights with his tie):** Anne, which tie?

**ANNE (choosing quickly):** The blue one, no stripes. 

**TOM (grabbing the tie amidst the bustle):** Right, thanks. (He finally spots his half-finished coffee, sighs, and takes a sip.) 

**WHISKERS (jumps suddenly from the sill to chase something invisible, almost colliding with the pancake batter bowl):** Meow!

**ANNE (pulling the bowl away just in time):** Oh no, you don't. Disaster averted.

**SARAH (clearing the last few items hastily):** More like, until lunchtime. 

**TOM (now with lunchboxes desperately trying to zip closed):** When did lunchboxes become harder than world domination?

**WHISKERS (saunters elegantly around the chaos):** Meow.

**ANNE (pushing a pancake plate into Tom's hands):** Your monarchy of midday meals awaits!

**SARAH (grabbing her bag):** I’ll rule class today, promise. Jack, let’s go.

**JACK (running towards the door, sneakers miraculously now on his feet):** With my crew, Sparky! 

**SPARKY (racing alongside):** Woof, woof!

**ANNE (watching the flurry, briefly letting herself pause):** Well, that’s the circus for another morning.

**TOM (chuckling, adding a last-minute peck on her cheek):** They should sell tickets.

**SARAH (calling from the door, amused):** Only if breakfast is included!

**Jack swings the door open dramatically, and they all usher out, leaving Anne and Tom to look at the beautifully chaotic remnants of breakfast.**

**ANNE (smiling at the mess):** Every show’s a hit, though. 

**TOM (grinning as they scramble out the door):** I wouldn’t miss it for the world.

**Lights fade as Tom and Anne hastily follow the children out, the kitchen, akin to a paused symphony of chaos, gradually falls silent. Only the wall clock ticks away, ready for the encore tomorrow.**

**Curtain.**

**THE BOX**

*A short play*

SETTING: A cramped attic filled with cardboard boxes, old furniture draped in sheets, and dusty memories. A small window provides the only natural light. Present day, late afternoon.

AT RISE: ANNA, 30s, wearing jeans and a practical button-down with sleeves rolled up, kneels beside an open trunk, methodically sorting items into labeled boxes. LEO, 30s, in a vintage band t-shirt and cargo pants, lounges against an old dresser, tossing a baseball in the air.

**ANNA**
(holding up a china teacup)
Do you remember these? The ones she'd never let us use?

**LEO**
(catching the ball)
"Not for children. Not for guests. Not for anyone, apparently."
(grins)
Why do people keep things they never use?

**ANNA**
They're antiques, Leo. They're worth—
(She stops, noticing something in the trunk)
Wait. What's this?

*She pulls out an ornate wooden box, approximately 12 inches square, with intricate carvings and a brass lock. LEO drops the baseball and moves closer.*

**LEO**
Whoa. That's gorgeous.

**ANNA**
(shaking it gently)
Something's inside. It's locked.

**LEO**
(reaching for it)
Let me see.

*ANNA pulls it away protectively.*

**ANNA**
Careful! This is old. Look at this craftsmanship—the inlay work, the dovetail joints...

**LEO**
(peering at it)
What do you think is in there?

**ANNA**
I don't know, but there has to be a key somewhere. We need to search systematically. Check the dresser drawers, I'll go through the—

**LEO**
(pulling out his keychain)
Or... I have a screwdriver on my multi-tool. Two seconds, and we're in.

**ANNA**
No! Absolutely not.

**LEO**
Come on, Anna. We've been up here for four hours. I'm covered in fifty years of dust, and my back hurts. Let's just pop it open.

**ANNA**
And destroy it? This box is probably worth more than everything else in this attic combined.

**LEO**
A box we can't open is worth exactly nothing.

**ANNA**
(standing, clutching the box)
That's not how value works. That's not how *anything* works. We find the key, we preserve the integrity of the piece, and then—

**LEO**
And then what? We "preserve" it in *your* apartment where no one touches it, just like Grandma did? Another fifty years of "integrity"?

*A beat. ANNA looks stung.*

**ANNA**
That's not fair.

**LEO**
(softening)
Hey, I'm sorry. I just... 
(sits on a covered chair)
Don't you want to know what's inside? What she thought was important enough to lock away?

**ANNA**
(quietly)
Of course I do.

**LEO**
Then let's find out. If we damage it—if *I* damage it—you can blame me. Like always.

**ANNA**
(a small smile)
You make that very easy.

*She looks at the box for a long moment, running her fingers over the carvings.*

**ANNA** (CONT'D)
These markings... I think they're letters. Look—here, and here.

*LEO stands and examines it over her shoulder.*

**LEO**
They're worn down. Can't quite...

**ANNA**
(tilting it toward the light)
It's Latin, maybe? Or... wait.
(excited)
It's a cipher. The letters correspond to... Leo, get Grandma's jewelry box. The small rosewood one.

**LEO**
The one with all the brooches?

**ANNA**
The one with the false bottom you found when you were twelve.

**LEO**
(heading toward a shelf)
The one I wasn't supposed to know about?

**ANNA**
(smiling despite herself)
That's the one.

*LEO retrieves a small jewelry box and brings it to ANNA. She opens it, feels along the bottom, and slides out a hidden panel. Inside is a small brass key.*

**LEO**
No way.

**ANNA**
(holding up the key)
Sometimes the patient approach works.

**LEO**
And sometimes you need a twelve-year-old with boundary issues.

*They kneel together. ANNA hands the key to LEO.*

**ANNA**
You open it.

**LEO**
(surprised)
Really?

**ANNA**
Really.

*LEO inserts the key. It turns with a soft click. They exchange a glance, and together, slowly lift the lid.*

*LIGHTS FADE as they look inside, their faces illuminated by whatever they've discovered.*

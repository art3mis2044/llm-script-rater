*(AT RISE: DIANE stands at the stove flipping pancakes while simultaneously packing lunches. ROBERT enters, tie half-done, searching frantically.)*

**ROBERT**  
Has anyone seen my presentation folder? The blue one? I have a meeting in forty-five minutes!

**DIANE**  
*(not looking up)*  
Check Jake's room. He was using it for his "spaceship console" yesterday.

**ROBERT**  
*(horrified)*  
My quarterly reports are in there!

*(JAKE zooms in, wearing a colander as a helmet, making laser sounds.)*

**JAKE**  
PEW PEW! I'm Space Commander Jake!

**DIANE**  
Jake, helmet off. Eat your pancakes.

**JAKE**  
Space commanders don't eat pancakes! They eat ASTEROID FUEL!

**ROBERT**  
Jake, where's my folder?

**JAKE**  
*(innocent)*  
What folder?

*(EMMA enters, still in pajamas, staring at her phone, hair wet.)*

**EMMA**  
*(dramatically)*  
My life is OVER.

**DIANE**  
Emma, why aren't you dressed? The bus comes in fifteen minutes!

**EMMA**  
Madison posted a photo wearing the EXACT same shirt I was going to wear today. I can't possibly go to school now. I'll be a laughingstock. A social pariah. I might as well drop out.

**ROBERT**  
Emma, get dressed. Jake, THE FOLDER.

**JAKE**  
I need to see the asteroid fuel first!

*(SOPHIE enters, fully dressed, carrying a large poster board.)*

**SOPHIE**  
Mom, I need someone to drive me early. My volcano presentation is today, and I need to set up.

**DIANE**  
*(flipping a pancake frantically)*  
Honey, I can't—I have a 9 AM meeting. Dad can—

**ROBERT**  
I can't! My presentation!

**SOPHIE**  
*(calculating)*  
Fine. Then I need thirty dollars for a rideshare.

**DIANE**  
You're seven! You're not taking a rideshare!

*(Smoke begins rising from the stove.)*

**DIANE** *(CONT'D)*  
Oh no—the pancakes!

*(She flips one; it flies through the air. JAKE catches it with his hands.)*

**JAKE**  
I CAUGHT THE ASTEROID!

**ROBERT**  
JAKE! The folder! NOW!

**JAKE**  
*(saluting)*  
It's in the recycling bin! I needed it to build a launch pad!

**ROBERT**  
*(running to recycling)*  
THE RECYCLING BIN?!

**EMMA**  
*(still on phone)*  
Mom, can you write me a note saying I'm sick?

**DIANE**  
No! Sophie, put your volcano in the car. Emma, you have ten minutes. Jake, eat something that's not a flying pancake!

*(ROBERT returns, holding a syrup-covered folder.)*

**ROBERT**  
It's... sticky.

**DIANE**  
Is it salvageable?

**ROBERT**  
*(peeling pages apart)*  
Define "salvageable."

**SOPHIE**  
Mom, my volcano won't fit in the car if Jake's "spaceship" is still in the back seat.

**JAKE**  
That's not a spaceship! That's my BATTLE STATION!

**EMMA**  
*(finally looking up)*  
Wait, why does Jake get to keep a battle station in the car, but I can't have a Starbucks stop on the way to school?

**DIANE**  
BECAUSE JAKE'S BATTLE STATION DOESN'T COST SIX DOLLARS!

*(Beat. Everyone freezes, staring at DIANE.)*

**DIANE** *(CONT'D)*  
*(takes a breath)*  
Okay. New plan. Robert, blow-dry your folder with the hair dryer. Emma, you're wearing whatever is clean—Madison will survive. Jake, remove the battle station. Sophie, you're riding with Dad.

**ROBERT**  
But my meeting—

**DIANE**  
—is in the same direction as Sophie's school. Jake, Emma, you're with me.

**JAKE**  
Can I bring my asteroid?

**DIANE**  
NO.

**EMMA**  
This is child abuse.

**DIANE**  
This is Wednesday.

*(Blackout as the chaos crescendos—everyone talking at once, the smoke alarm begins beeping.)*

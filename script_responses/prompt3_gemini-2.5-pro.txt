**Title:** The Gravy Boat of Damocles

**Characters:**

*   **SARAH BREWER** (40s) - The frazzled, optimistic host.
*   **DAVID BREWER** (40s) - The peace-keeping, perpetually nervous husband.
*   **LILY BREWER** (16) - Their daughter, deadpan and permanently attached to her phone.
*   **NANA ROSE** (70s) - Sarah’s mother. Dressed in a sequined track suit, big sunglasses perched on her head. Energetic, loud, and fabulous.
*   **GRANDMA AGNES** (70s) - David’s mother. Wears a stiff, tweed dress and a judgmental expression. A woman of iron-clad tradition.
*   **GOOSE** - A plump, white pet chicken.

**Setting:**

The dining room of the Brewer’s suburban home. The table is immaculately set, groaning with Thanksgiving food. The centerpiece is a massive, perfectly browned turkey.

**(The scene opens. The entire family is seated around the dining table. There is a palpable tension in the air, thick enough to cut with a gravy ladle. DAVID stands, electric knife poised dramatically over the turkey.)**

**DAVID**
Alright, everyone! The moment of truth. Who wants white meat, who wants—

**GRANDMA AGNES**
(Dabbing her lips with a linen napkin)
David, before you desecrate that beautiful bird, shouldn't we say grace? A proper grace. Not the sing-songy jingle Rose taught Lily last year about a turkey in the straw.

**NANA ROSE**
(Waving a dismissive hand, her many bracelets jangling)
Oh, lighten up, Agnes. A little razzle-dazzle never hurt anyone. In Vegas, we just high-five the dealer and call it a blessing. I hit the jackpot on the "Wheel of Fortune" slot, by the way. Bought myself this track suit. It’s Italian.

**GRANDMA AGNES**
It's chartreuse. And it's blinding. I believe my retinas have been permanently seared.

**SARAH**
(A tight, desperate smile)
Okay! How about David says grace, and then we can all enjoy this wonderful meal I spent two days preparing! How does that sound? Wonderful! David?

**DAVID**
(Clearing his throat nervously)
Right. Lord, we are thankful for this… uh… bounty. And for family. All of our family. Together. In one room. And we are especially thankful that Goose is safe and sound and not… well, you know. Amen.

**GRANDMA AGNES**
(Eyes narrowing)
What does he mean, "not you know"? What happened to the chicken?

**LILY**
(Not looking up from her phone)
Dad almost roasted him. He had Goose in the pan with the giblets and everything before Mom screamed.

**NANA ROSE**
A little paprika, he would’ve been delicious! Just kidding! I love that little feathered high-roller. Where is he, anyway?

**(A soft clucking is heard from under the table. Nana Rose discreetly drops a piece of bread onto the floor.)**

**SARAH**
(Hissing at David)
Did you have to bring that up?

**DAVID**
It felt relevant to my thankfulness!

**GRANDMA AGNES**
You keep a live barnyard animal in the house? Sarah, your grandmother would be spinning in her grave. She kept a clean home. Her doilies were always bleached.

**NANA ROSE**
Her doilies were a fire hazard and you know it, Agnes. I, for one, think Goose adds a certain… *je ne sais quoi*. My new friend, Sergio—the croupier from Caesars Palace—he raises peacocks. Now *that’s* a conversation piece.

**GRANDMA AGNES**
I’m sure he has many stories to tell. Most likely to a parole officer. Sarah, these mashed potatoes are lumpy. My recipe calls for a ricer, not a masher. It makes all the difference.

**SARAH**
(Through gritted teeth)
I used a ricer, Agnes.

**DAVID**
They’re delicious, honey. Just perfect. Now, the turkey!

**(David finally lowers the electric knife. It whirs to life with a loud BUZZZZ. As the blade touches the turkey’s skin, a white flash erupts from under the table. GOOSE, with a startled squawk, launches himself upwards. He lands squarely in the middle of the table, sending a bowl of cranberry sauce flying. A dollop of it lands perfectly on Grandma Agnes’s stiffly coiffed grey hair.)**

**(Silence. Everyone stares. Goose lets out a triumphant cluck, pecking at a stray stuffing crumb.)**

**LILY**
(Finally looking up from her phone, a small smile on her face)
Dinner and a show.

**NANA ROSE**
(Beaming)
Now that’s what I call a Vegas-style floor show! Bravo, Goose! Bravo! He’s got more pizazz than the Cirque du Soleil!

**(Grandma Agnes sits ramrod straight, a single drop of cranberry sauce trickling down her temple. Her face is a mask of pure, unadulterated fury. She slowly raises a finger and points a trembling hand at the bird.)**

**GRANDMA AGNES**
He… is standing… in the gravy.

**(Sarah stares at the chaos: the chicken, the cranberry-splattered grandmother, the look of horror on her husband’s face. She lets out a long, slow breath. She picks up a serving spoon.)**

**SARAH**
(Voice eerily calm)
Pass the gravy. The one without the chicken in it.

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**

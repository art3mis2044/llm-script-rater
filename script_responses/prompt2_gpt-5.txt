[Morning. A middle-class family kitchen. A fridge covered with crayon drawings and a crowded whiteboard calendar. A digital clock reads 7:03 AM. A pancake griddle sizzles. An exhausted coffee maker whirs. The sink is full. A school backpack avalanche threatens from a chair.]

MAYA (the mother), hair in a hurried bun, stands at the calendar with a dry-erase marker like a baton. DAN (the father), in a wrinkled button-down and apron that says “Kiss the Cook (And Run),” prods pancakes. MAX (12), serious but scattered, has a shoebox diorama and a small volcano model on the table. LILA (9), bright and loud, clutches a recorder and wears mismatched socks. BISCUIT (a goofy golden mutt) patrols underfoot, and QUEEN NOODLE (a regal cat) sits on the counter, tail twitching.

MAYA
All right, team, it’s Wednesday. Tight ship. Departure is seven-thirty sharp. Shoes by the door, backpacks on backs, teeth brushed like you actually own them. We can do this.

DAN
We can do this.

MAX
I need dirt.

MAYA
What?

MAX
For my ecosystem diorama. And also vinegar. And also glue. And also—

LILA (to Maya)
Do you sign the zoo permission slip in cursive or fancy cursive?

DAN (calls over his shoulder)
Max, you’re twelve, your ecosystem can contain hope and imagination.

MAX
That’s not scientifically viable, Dad.

LILA to QUEEN NOODLE
Your ecosystem contains purring.

QUEEN NOODLE flicks her tail directly into a butter dish.

MAYA
Lila, where’s your gym shoe?

LILA gets very still, then glances at her feet. One sneaker. One of Maya’s nude heels.

LILA
It’s… an ankle support prototype?

MAYA
Take my heel off.

DAN flips a pancake too enthusiastically; it lands half-on the stove knob.

DAN
I made the spaceship pancake you wanted.

LILA
That is a blob, father.

MAYA
Where are my keys?

DAN
Have you checked the freezer?

MAYA
Why would—?

DAN
Because last week we found the remote in the flour. We’re… creative people.

BISCUIT noses a cereal bowl off the table. It hits the floor with a spectacular splash. Biscuit looks delighted. Queen Noodle looks offended and higher than anyone else on the counter.

MAYA (exasperated)
Paper towels!

LILA darts to the cabinet, pulls out plastic bags.

LILA
We’re out. But I made a cape.

She drapes one over Biscuit. Biscuit is thrilled. He dashes in circles, tangling around Dan’s legs.

DAN staggers, catching himself with a pan. The pancake burns.

DAN
Hypothetical question: how important is it that pancakes be edible?

The smoke alarm begins its shrill chorus.

MAYA (already on a dining chair, fanning)
Very important!

BISCUIT thinks this is the call to arms and barks joyfully. QUEEN NOODLE bolts up onto the top of the fridge, dislodging magnets, a spelling test, and the zoo permission slip. It falls—right into Dan’s coffee.

LILA
No!

MAYA snatches the slip, now tan and soggy.

MAYA
We can dry it. Dan, hair dryer.

DAN
We have a toaster.

MAYA
Please don’t—

DAN clips the edge of the permission slip in the toaster like a genius. It immediately singes. He yanks it out, slapping it against the counter.

DAN
Artisanal char.

The smoke alarm crescendos. Maya climbs off the chair, shoves the window open. Cold air and a neighbor’s lawn mower join the orchestra. Dan finally smothers the alarm with a dish towel.

MAX, oblivious, arranges his shoebox with precision. He sprinkles sugar on the “ground.”

MAYA (catching him)
Is that sugar?

MAX (full of absolute sincerity)
Snow.

MAYA
It’s July. In your ecosystem.

MAX
Global weirding.

LILA
Mom, my recorder recital is next Tuesday. Please preview Twinkle Twinkle—

She blows a long, uncertain note. Biscuit howls. Queen Noodle’s ears flatten so far they disappear.

DAN (hand on heart)
It moved me. Mostly out the door.

MAYA locates her keys in the freezer behind a bag of peas. She holds them up like treasure.

MAYA
I’m never doubting you again. That’s a Wednesday-only promise.

Her phone buzzes. She answers, puts her boss on speaker.

MAYA (into phone, too bright)
Good morning, Cheryl! Yes, I’ll be in for the nine o’clock—Hi, we have a minor—No, that’s the smoke alarm. No one is on fire. Yet.

DAN pours more batter on the griddle. His coffee machine wheezes. He tips a spoonful of what he thinks is sugar into his mug, sips. He shudders violently.

DAN
Who put salt in the sugar jar?

LILA raises her hand like a tiny felon.

LILA
Science?

MAX (eyes lighting)
Speaking of science, can I… test my volcano real quick? I need to calibrate flow.

MAYA
Define “test,” define “real quick.”

MAX pours vinegar into the volcano. Foam burbles, then cascades over the sides, across the table, into the open lunchboxes like a pink tide.

DAN
Tectonic activity on the sandwich plate!

LILA squeals with delighted horror, backing her recorder into the bowl of pancake batter. The recorder is instantly half-full of goo.

LILA
My instrument!

She blows reflexively. Pancake batter bubbles out the holes in a slow, sad melody. Biscuit licks it. Queen Noodle is aghast.

MAYA, still on the call, moves the phone off speaker, but we still hear faint Cheryl tones.

MAYA (muttering)
Cheryl, I have to—yes, I know the deliverable—give me six minutes—no, seven—okay, nine, it’s an omen.

DAN tries to help by tilting the lunchbox. The volcano foam pours down his sleeve. He looks at it, resigned.

DAN
I work in finance. Why am I wearing foam.

MAX beams.
MAX
Because science is everywhere.

LILA tries her recorder again, now making a bubbling honk. Biscuit sneezes.

MAYA pulls bread from the bag, realizes only the heel slices remain.

MAYA
Goodbye, hopes.

DAN (rallying)
They love heel toast.

LILA
No one loves heel toast.

MAX
Grandpa loves heel toast because he grew up in the Depression.

DAN
Well, it’s time you learned about character.

The coffee machine gurgles and sputters brown sludge onto the counter. Dan uses the one clean dish towel to corral the flood. It was not clean for long.

MAYA scribbles her signature on the shrunken, singed permission slip. It reads like “Mrya Jgle.”

MAYA
If anyone asks, my name is Mrya today.

QUEEN NOODLE tiptoes across the stove to avoid biscuit licks, pressing a burner knob. A lazy blue flame blooms under nothing. Maya lunges to turn it off.

MAYA (to cat)
Absolutely not, your highness.

DAN slides two pancakes onto a plate. They are… shapes.

DAN (proud)
Nature-inspired.

MAX
They look like continents post-breakup.

LILA
Mine looks like Ohio crying.

MAYA breathes in. She looks at the clock. 7:27.

MAYA (command voice)
All right! Shoes. Backpacks. Teeth. Hair. Grab your lunches—no, not those, those are… foam-adjacent. New plan: cafeteria. Everyone say thank you to the cafeteria.

LILA and MAX
Thank you to the cafeteria.

DAN hands them each a banana and a granola bar as if presenting medals.

DAN
This is breakfast now.

BISCUIT noses his now-caped self under the table and emerges wearing a gym sock on one ear.

MAYA
Lila—your shoe.

LILA points proudly. She has found it and is wearing both. Backwards.

MAYA
Frontwards. Let’s respect frontwards.

LILA switches them. Sort of.

MAX shoves the diorama into his backpack. It doesn’t fit. He forces it. The volcano pops out, landing in Dan’s briefcase.

DAN
No. No, absolutely not.

MAX (smooth)
You work in finance. You can broker a lava deal.

DAN’s phone vibrates on the counter. The caller ID says “Board Meeting.” He answers, trying to sound composed.

DAN (into phone, soft)
Good morning—no, that’s my son’s—yes, a science demonstration—very relevant to interest rates—ha ha—no, I didn’t say “rates,” I said “plates,” like tectonic plates—

MAYA, while putting on her jacket, winces and pulls a wireless earbud out of her hair. It’s coated in pancake batter from a prior disaster this very morning. She wipes it on a dish towel and thinks better, then wipes it on Dan’s apron.

MAYA
Sorry.

DAN
We share everything.

QUEEN NOODLE, sensing departure, slinks to the door to block it with her entire spite.

MAYA kneels, kisses Biscuit on the head, then addresses the room.

MAYA
We are leaving in ninety seconds. This ship departs whether or not you’re the captain. Checks: homework?

MAX
I did it at 6:14 AM like a legend.

MAYA
Shoes?

LILA
Frontwards-ish.

MAYA
Coats?

MAX
Weather app says “maybe.”

MAYA
We live in reality, not the weather app. Dan?

DAN holds up his keys and his dignity, both slightly sticky.

DAN
Present and… pancake-adjacent.

MAYA breathes. It’s a soldier’s breath. The collective air of a thousand Wednesdays.

MAYA (gentler)
Okay. We can do this. We’re a team. Remember? Even if our team smells like syrup and fear.

LILA gives a thumbs-up with a pancake-printed thumb.

MAX salutes with a test tube.

DAN looks at Maya, then at the disaster they leave in their wake.

DAN
We’ll clean tonight?

MAYA
We’ll burn it down and start over.

BISCUIT barks once, as if seconding.

QUEEN NOODLE blinks, immortal.

They all surge toward the door. Then—

LILA (sudden)
My permission slip!

MAYA slaps it into her hand like a relay baton.

MAYA
Run.

MAX (at the threshold)
I love you, Biscuit! Bye, Queen Noodle! Do not base-jump off the fridge while we’re out!

QUEEN NOODLE yawns like a threat.

They spill out into the morning, still buttoning, still chewing, still laughing. The kitchen exhales and hums in their absence—pancake smudges, a faint smell of lava, the distant echo of a recorder that will never, ever be clean again.

The clock shifts to 7:31.

Blackout.

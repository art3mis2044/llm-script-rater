**Title: Turkey, Traditions, and a Chicken Named Goose**

*Setting: The dining room of the Brewer’s house. The room is festively decorated with autumn leaves and a lavish, mismatched set of dishes. The dining table is cluttered with food, including a grand turkey. An old oak cabinet stands against one wall, adorned with pictures of the family. In the center, a cage holds a pet chicken labeled "GOOSE."*

*Characters:*
- **JOHN BREWER**: Early 40s, the father and host, trying to keep the peace.
- **MARIA BREWER**: Late 30s, the mother, calm but frazzled by chaos.
- **GRANDMA DORIS**: Mid-70s, John's mother, strict and traditional.
- **GRANDMA KATE**: Early 70s, Maria’s mother, very hip, snazzy, and just back from Vegas.
- **SUZY**: 10 years old, energetic daughter.
- **CHARLIE**: 7 years old, curious son.
- **GOOSE**: The family’s pet chicken.

*As the scene opens, JOHN and MARIA are setting the table. SUZY and CHARLIE chase Goose, the chicken, which flutters around the room.*

**JOHN:** (exasperated) Suzy, Charlie! Can you please get Goose out of here before Grandma Doris makes him into an appetizer?

**MARIA:** (gently) And remember, Charlie dear, Goose is our pet, not the dinner.

*(SUZY and CHARLIE manage to catch Goose and put him back in his small cage.)*

**SUZY:** (giggling) Maybe Goose can be dessert!

*(Enter GRANDMA DORIS, carrying a heavy platter and directing an imaginary orchestra of organization.)*

**GRANDMA DORIS:** In my day, we had proper pets like dogs or cats, not... poultry. And we definitely didn't let them run around on holidays!

*(Enter GRANDMA KATE, wearing glittery sunglasses and a sequined blazer that screams Vegas. She carries a bag filled with souvenirs.)*

**GRANDMA KATE:** (with swagger) Ah, Vegas! They know how to celebrate there—lights, music, excitement! Not that any of you squares would understand.

**GRANDMA DORIS:** Hmph! Not everyone appreciates such frivolity, Kate. Thanksgiving is about family, not slot machines and... what are those ridiculous feather boas you keep bringing home?

**GRANDMA KATE:** (defiantly) Oh, Doris, live a little. You're just upset because your cranberry sauce is always a bit too tart!

**JOHN:** (chiming in quickly) Alright, alright, let’s focus on the positives. Like how the turkey didn’t actually turn into Goose this year.

*(MARIA signals SUZY and CHARLIE to sit down at the table before addressing both grandmas.)*

**MARIA:** Mom, we are so glad to have you both here. Let’s toast to being together, no matter how different we are.

**GRANDMA KATE:** (raising an imaginary glass) To family and luck! And to Goose, for keeping himself out of trouble!

**GRANDMA DORIS:** (grudgingly raising her real glass) To family traditions... and behaving grandchildren. Let’s not talk of what happens in Vegas, shall we?

*(GOOSE clucks loudly, causing everyone at the table to turn to his cage. They all laugh, momentarily united in the hilarity of the situation.)*

**JOHN:** (grinning) Okay, everyone! Who's ready for some turkey?

*(The stage lights dim slightly, focusing briefly on Goose preening happily in his cage. The tension slips away as laughter and chatter fill the room.)*

*The scene closes with the family starting to serve dinner, the grandmas continuing a playful bicker, and the children sneaking bits of food to Goose under the table.*

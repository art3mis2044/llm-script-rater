Title: In Tents

Night. A small campground clearing. Two slightly-too-small tents stand unevenly. Crickets chirp. A cooler, a tangled pile of sleeping bags, and a skewed lantern. The moon is bright. Distant owl hoots.

Enter six teens, tiptoeing with backpacks.

Ava (whispering, clutching a binder): According to the master plan, we arrive at 00:17 hours. It is 00:21. We are four minutes behind schedule because someone had to—

Noah (also whispering, panicked): Pee! It was the pre-pee. There’s a system.

Zoe (hissing, filming on her phone): Guys, whisper aesthetic. Sneaking-into-the-night content does not vibe with panic sweat.

Ethan (already unrolling a tent): If we want shelter before dew point, I need silence. And stakes.

Marco (brandishing a bag of chips): Stakes? I brought steaks. Just kidding. Vegan jerky. Also this trip is going to be… in tents. Get it? In tents?

Lena (deadpan, staring at the sky): The moon disapproves of you and your pun.

Ava: Okay, team. Tent A is for girls, Tent B for boys. Ethan, you’re on knots. Marco, food goes up in a bear bag. Noah—

Noah: Bathroom. Again. I feel like a Capri Sun with abandonment issues.

Ethan (handing him a flashlight): Buddy system. I’ll take you to the designated tree. From here, left at the stump, past the suspiciously pointy bush—

Lena: The suspiciously pointy bush? Sounds like a YA novel I would absolutely not read.

Zoe (to her camera): Senior Trip: DIY edition. No parents, no rules, just me and my highlight surviving the wilderness—

Ava (snatching the phone down slightly): No posting until we’re home alive. If my mom sees this she’ll FaceTime the owls.

Zoe: Owls have service?

Ava: My mom has service with everything.

Ethan and Noah disappear left with the flashlight beam bobbing.

Marco (peering at the tents): These look… smaller than the internet implied.

Lena: Like expectations, they collapse under scrutiny.

Ava: They’re “cozy.” We will sleep in eight-hour shifts of deep restorative—

A sudden rip. Ethan’s tent flap detaches. Ethan freezes mid-knot.

Ethan: Okay. So… I can fix that. I have duct tape, paracord, and optimism. Two of those are useful.

Zoe (gasps): Is that a frog? There’s a frog. I can’t say “ribbit” in a flattering way.

A rustle near the cooler.

Marco (bravely, with a headlamp): Halt! Identify yourself, crunchy night ghost!

A masked raccoon pops its head out of the cooler. It holds a bag of Flamin’ Cheetos in tiny hands. Everyone screams in whispers.

Ava: Oh my god. The food! The plan!

Ethan (returning with Noah, who looks relieved): Don’t make eye contact. They’re cute and they know it.

Noah: He stole the Cheetos. He has no morals.

Raccoon stares and rips the Cheetos open with surgical precision.

Lena (softly): The bandit makes a mockery of capitalism.

Zoe: Not the Cheetos! That’s my brand identity!

Marco: I’ve been ra-coon’ed.

A coyote howls faintly in the distance. Everyone freezes.

Noah (whisper-whisper screaming): Was that a wolf? Should we climb a tree? Can I pee in a tree? Is that—ethically?

Ethan: It’s a coyote, and no one is peeing in a tree. We go back to the tents. Slowly. No sudden movements. Also, close the cooler; we don’t want to attract skunks.

Zoe: SKUNKS?

The raccoon knocks the cooler over, rummaging through marshmallows now like a tiny, adorable thief.

Ava (near tears, flapping her binder): This is not in the binder. The binder did not anticipate raccoon betrayal.

Lena: No binder anticipates betrayal.

Marco attempts to shoo the raccoon by clapping. The raccoon hisses, offended. Marco retreats.

Ethan (softly): Okay. Back away. We regroup. Ava, breathe. Zoe, phone down. Noah—

Noah: I have to go again. The sound of cooler rummaging triggers me.

Ethan (exhausted but gentle): Buddy system. Again.

Noah and Ethan shuffle off. The raccoon takes the marshmallows and leaves with dignity.

Ava (to herself): Fine. We lose the marshmallows. We recover. We adapt. We—

Zoe (checking her phone): No bars. Zero. How do people tell time? By the stars? Is Orion on Eastern or Pacific?

Lena: Time is a flat circle filled with raccoons.

Marco (peeking into Tent B): Okay, so here’s a twist: Tent B is less “tent” and more “fabric suggestion.” It’s like a napkin you can crawl into.

Ava: We are not going back. We planned this since fifth grade. Senior Trip or Senior… Quit. Do you want to be Senior Quit?

Marco: Sounds like an album. “Senior Quit (feat. Raccoon).”

Owl hoot. Bush rustle. Noah’s voice faintly: That’s… that’s a skunk, right? Ethan?

Ethan (offstage): Everyone, freeze!

Everyone freezes.

Zoe (unfreezing a little): I can’t freeze. My leg’s asleep. My leg is dead. Tell my leg’s family.

A faint but distinct spray sound. Followed by Ethan: We are fine. Mostly fine. We are going to live with choices.

Noah and Ethan return, mortified and slightly fragrant. Zoe recoils dramatically.

Zoe: Oh no. Oh no! Eau de forest.

Noah: It grazed my shoe. I’m a hazard cone.

Marco: You’re… in scents-itive circumstances.

Lena: Your dignity has evaporated with the dew.

Ava, on the brink: It’s okay. Okay. We will sleep. We will nap in shifts. No one moves; no one eats; no one breathes near the skunk. We sleep.

She herds everyone toward the tents. After an awkward, shuffling eternity, they squeeze: Girls in Tent A, boys in Tent B. The tents wobble like cupcakes under assault.

Inside the tents: muffled complaining.

Zoe (from Tent A): Your elbow is in my hair, Priya—

Lena: I am not Priya. I am existential dread. But also Lena. Move your elbow.

Ava: Shhh. We need sleep. If we sleep, in four hours we can hike to Sunrise Ridge per the plan—

Marco (from Tent B): My calf is outside the tent. Is that fatal?

Ethan: Your calf will survive. Don’t touch your shoe, Noah.

Noah: Too late.

A beat. Crickets. Silence inches in. Then—

Noah: I have to—

All: NO.

Noah (a squeaky whisper): It’s psychological now.

Ava bangs her forehead lightly against a pillow.

Zoe: My ring light is in the other tent. This is my villain origin story.

Lena (murmuring like a bedtime story): Once upon a time, six youths tempted fate. The forest said “lol.”

Thwack. Something bumps Tent B. The boys freeze. Thwack. A shadow passes. A deer silhouette. Then a snort from very close. Marco yelps.

Ethan (low, steady): That’s a deer. They’re large grass puppies. Do not panic.

Noah: The grass puppy is judging me.

From the road beyond the trees: car doors. Voices. The sweep of bright flashlights.

Ava sits bolt upright in Tent A, smacking Zoe and Lena with her binder.

Ava: No. No. No no no no—

Zoe: We’re trending! In a bad way!

Voices, overlapping, parental, approaching:

Mom 1: Ava Lillian Torres!

Dad 2: Ethan Paul Ng!

Mom 3: Zoe! Unplug your ring light and come out right now!

Dad 4: Marco, I can literally see your foot sticking out of a tent.

Mom 5: Noah. Sweetheart. Why does it smell like—

Noah (small): Choices.

Lena (dreamily): The moon sent them.

A flood of flashlights hits the clearing. The tents light up like lanterns. The raccoon, now seated like a tiny king with a marshmallow stuck to its whisker, watches the arrest.

Parents enter, wielding sheer parental disappointment. The teens spill out, blinking.

Ava (straightening, meek): Hi, Mom. You found us.

Ava’s Mom (holding up a phone): Find My Child. And Mrs. Patel called me because you posted a “no parents, just vibes” poll two hours ago.

Zoe (hands up): It was a non-binding poll!

Ethan’s Dad (taking in the skunk situation): Son. You smell… prepared for consequences.

Ethan (saluting instinctively): Yes, sir.

Marco’s Dad: You’re all grounded. Pun intended.

Marco (deflated, still can’t stop himself): Wow. Grounds. Camping. Coffee grounds. Dad, please stop before I do.

Noah’s Mom (hugging Noah at awkward arm’s length): Bathroom at home. Now.

Noah: I accept my fate.

Lena’s Aunt (to Lena): I’m impressed. Your note said “I go where the existential wind blows.” I assumed you meant the porch.

Lena: The existential wind is skunky.

Ava, trying to salvage dignity: We planned it so carefully. We just wanted to prove we could.

Ava’s Mom (softening but still firm): Planning isn’t the same as permission. Also, raccoons.

Everyone looks at the raccoon. It licks a marshmallow. Slowly, as if on cue, the raccoon hisses at the parents’ shoes. The parents all step back in unison.

Zoe (whispering to her camera): Final update: Parents are here, wildlife is petty, and my highlight held. Like and subscribe to my grounding.

Ava’s Mom: Phones. Now.

They all surrender their phones.

Ethan’s Dad: Pack it up. Tents down. We’ll talk in the morning. And by “talk” I mean “never stop talking about this until college.”

Marco (sighing): Guess this is the Senior Trip: Parent Remix.

Lena: Act II: Consequences.

Noah: Intermission—bathroom.

Ava looks at her friends, at the tents, at the moon. She can’t help a tiny smile.

Ava: For what it’s worth… we did it. We made it to the campsite.

Ethan (shouldering a tent, wincing): That is technically accurate.

Zoe (raising an imaginary glass): To our nightmare dream.

Marco: To being… in tents… with our parents.

All groan as they start collapsing the tents amid a chorus of crickets, distant coyotes, and plentiful lectures. The raccoon succeeds in opening the s’mores chocolate and, like a tiny judge, shakes its head.

Blackout.

**SETTING:** *The Brewer family dining room. A beautifully set table with autumn decorations. A kitchen door stage left, front door stage right.*

**AT RISE:** *JANET frantically arranges place settings while TOM struggles with a turkey on a platter. MAYA sits texting.*

**JANET:** Tom, for the love of— the turkey goes in the CENTER of the table!

**TOM:** It weighs twenty pounds, Janet! I'm trying not to—

*(GOOSE the chicken struts across the stage, pecking at decorative corn)*

**MAYA:** (*not looking up*) Mom, Goose is eating the centerpiece again.

**JANET:** GOOSE! Out! OUT! (*shooing*) Tom, I told you to put him in the garage!

**TOM:** He gets lonely!

*(Doorbell rings. JANET freezes in horror)*

**JANET:** They're here. Maya, get the door. Tom, hide the chicken!

**TOM:** (*scooping up GOOSE*) Come on, buddy. Remember, you're the lucky one.

*(MAYA opens door. GRANDMA VEGAS struts in wearing a sequined track suit and oversized sunglasses)*

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** What happens in Vegas follows you home, baby! (*strikes a pose*) Gobble gobble, my gorgeous offspring!

**MAYA:** Grandma Vegas! Did you win big?

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Won enough to get this tattoo! (*rolls up sleeve*) 

**JANET:** (*horrified*) Is that... a turkey wearing a crown?

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** It's ironic! The artist's name was Sage, like the stuffing! Where's my martini?

*(Another knock. MAYA opens door to reveal GRANDMA RUTH, dressed conservatively, holding a casserole dish)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** (*seeing Vegas*) Oh. You're here.

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Ruth! Still shopping at Forever 71?

**GRANDMA RUTH:** (*icily*) Margaret. Still dressing like a disco ball, I see.

**JANET:** (*forced cheer*) Mom! Ruth! So glad you could both make it!

*(GOOSE escapes from TOM's arms, runs between the grandmas)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** Is that... a CHICKEN at the dinner table?

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Oh, I love it! Very avant-garde!

**TOM:** That's Goose. He's... part of the family.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** You named a chicken "Goose"? What's next, a turkey named Duck?

**MAYA:** Actually, that's not a bad idea—

**JANET:** ANYWAY! Let's sit! Tom, carve the turkey!

*(Everyone sits. TOM begins carving. GOOSE hops onto the table)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** This is exactly why tradition matters. In my day, livestock stayed OUTSIDE.

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** In your day, they also thought Elvis was scandalous. (*to GOOSE*) Come here, handsome!

*(GOOSE struts to VEGAS, who feeds him corn)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** Don't encourage it! Janet, surely you're not allowing this.

**JANET:** (*eye twitching*) It's fine. Everything's FINE.

**TOM:** (*nervous*) So, Vegas, how was the trip?

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Incredible! I did a zipline over Fremont Street! At night! Nude!

*(RUTH drops her fork)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** NUDE?!

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Kidding! (*winks*) I wore pasties.

**MAYA:** (*finally interested*) Grandma Vegas, you're my hero.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** This is exactly what's wrong with society! No boundaries! No propriety! Next you'll tell me you got married to an Elvis impersonator!

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Don't be ridiculous, Ruth. (*pause*) It was a Cher impersonator.

*(JANET stands abruptly)*

**JANET:** WHO WANTS PIE?!

**TOM:** Honey, we haven't even—

*(GOOSE jumps onto the turkey platter, sending stuffing flying. RUTH shrieks, VEGAS laughs, MAYA films)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** That's IT! That chicken should have been dinner!

**GRANDMA VEGAS:** Over my bedazzled body!

*(Both grandmas stand, facing off over the table. GOOSE pecks at the turkey triumphantly)*

**TOM:** (*to audience*) Every year, I suggest we go to a restaurant...

**JANET:** (*pouring wine directly from bottle*) I'm thankful for wine. So. Very. Thankful.

**MAYA:** (*filming*) This is definitely going viral.

*(GOOSE crows victoriously as lights fade)*

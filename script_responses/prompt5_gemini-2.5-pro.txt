## Flight 305 to Insanity

**A Short Scene**

by [Your Name]

**CHARACTERS:**

*   **MIKE** (17): Just a kid trying to get home. Our weary protagonist.
*   **BARBARA** (60s): A woman for whom every bump is the beginning of the end.
*   **LEO** (20s): A guitarist with the serene calm of a man who has seen it all.
*   **CHLOE** (30s): A flight attendant. Her heart is currently in the emergency exit row.
*   **THE ECCENTRICS** (A motley crew):
    1.  **TRENT**, a finance bro yelling into his phone.
    2.  **MADISYN**, an influencer vlogging her "authentic travel journey."
    3.  **A MIME**, practicing being in a box.
    4.  **AGNES**, knitting a scarf the length of the aisle.
    5.  & 6. **FLORA and FAUNA**, identical twins who speak in unison.
    7.  **MARTHA**, a prim woman holding a taxidermied squirrel she calls "Mr. Nuts."
    8.  **WALLY**, an overly enthusiastic tourist in a loud Hawaiian shirt.
    9.  **GARY**, a conspiracy theorist muttering about chemtrails.
    10. **MR. GIGGLES**, an off-duty clown, full makeup, looking morose.
    11. **EXHAUSTED MOTHER**, with the source of the chaos: **THE CRYING BABY**.

**SETTING:**

The cabin of a commercial airplane, mid-flight. The air is stale and thick with tension.

**(The scene opens. MIKE is crammed in a middle seat, headphones on, eyes closed, desperately seeking peace. To his right, LEO lightly strums a small travel guitar, a mellow, pleasant chord. To his left, the aisle. The high-pitched, relentless wail of a BABY pierces through everything.)**

**(Across the aisle, BARBARA grips her armrests, her knuckles white. Her eyes are wide, darting around the cabin.)**

**BARBARA**
(To no one in particular)
Did you feel that? A dip. A definite dip. The port engine is sputtering. I can hear it. It sounds... asthmatic.

**(WALLY, two rows up, gives a thumbs up to Madisyn, who is filming him with her phone.)**

**WALLY**
Next stop, Margaritaville! Woo!

**MADISYN**
(To her phone)
Okay, so the vibe on this flight is, like, super real, guys. Very authentic. Hashtag-sky-high.

**(The plane suddenly SHAKES with a sharp jolt of turbulence. The cabin groans. The BABY’s cry escalates to a full-blown shriek.)**

**BARBARA**
(Screaming)
THIS IS IT! THE SPUTTERING! I TOLD YOU! We’re a rock in the sky! A metal coffin! OH, SWEET HEAVENS, I NEVER LEARNED TO JUGGLE!

**(LEO doesn’t miss a beat, transitioning his strumming into a slightly more dramatic, bluesy riff. He looks over at Mike and gives a small, calm shrug.)**

**LEO**
Just an air pocket, man. The sky’s got potholes, too.

**MIKE**
(Pulling off his headphones)
It has potholes, a screaming baby, and a mime.

**(Mike gestures with his head. The MIME is now pressed against the window, hands flat, his face a mask of silent horror at being trapped in a rapidly descending, invisible box.)**

**(Up front, TRENT is yelling into his phone.)**

**TRENT**
Leverage the assets, Derek! I don’t care if the sky is falling, you LEVERAGE!

**(Another, more violent LURCH. Several overhead bins pop open. Agnes’s ball of yarn rolls down the aisle like a fuse. Mr. Giggles the clown lets out a single, tragic sob.)**

**FLORA AND FAUNA**
(In perfect unison)
The pressure is changing.

**GARY**
(To Martha’s squirrel)
It’s the chemtrails. They’re reversing the ionosphere to make us more compliant.

**(The FASTEN SEATBELT sign dings aggressively. A crackle from the intercom, followed by a choked, wet sniffle.)**

**CHLOE (V.O.)**
(Over intercom, voice trembling)
Ladies and... *hic*... gentlemen. This is your... flight attendant, Chloe. The captain has... has asked everyone to remain seated as we... as we fly through this patch of... of emotional and atmospheric instability.

**(A pause. Just the roar of the engines and the crying baby.)**

**CHLOE (V.O.)**
(Voice breaking completely)
It’s just like Chad. He said he needed ‘space.’ Well, here you go, Chad! Thirty-thousand feet of space! Are you happy now?! He packed his things in my favorite suitcase! The one with the good wheels! He said... he said I was ‘too turbulent.’

**(Chloe dissolves into loud, inconsolable sobs over the intercom. The entire cabin sits in stunned silence. Even the baby stops crying for a second, confused.)**

**CHLOE (V.O.)**
(Wailing)
HE TOOK THE AIR FRYER, YOU GUYS! THE AIR FRYER! WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DOES THAT?!

**(The intercom clicks off with a sharp pop. The silence is deafening. Mike stares straight ahead, his face a blank mask of disbelief. The turbulence subsides.)**

**(Leo slowly, thoughtfully, plays a single, sad C-minor chord on his guitar. It hangs in the air.)**

**(Mike slowly turns to Leo, his eyes wide and lifeless.)**

**MIKE**
My grandma gave me a hundred dollars for my birthday.

**(Leo nods, looking at him with deep, profound understanding.)**

**LEO**
That’s not enough, man.

**MIKE**
(Shakes his head)
It’s not even close.

**(The baby starts crying again. Mike puts his headphones back on, but doesn't press play. He just sits there, listening to the muffled chaos of his own personal hell.)**

**(BLACKOUT.)**

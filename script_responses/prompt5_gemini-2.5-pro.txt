**Title:** Turbulent Souls
**Setting:** The cramped, chaotic economy cabin of Flight 305 to Florida.
**Time:** The present. Mid-flight.

**(The scene opens on a cacophony of noise. A BABY is wailing relentlessly. Across the aisle, a large SNORING MAN is producing a sound like a faulty chainsaw. In the seat behind MIKE (17, looking utterly exhausted), a kid named KEVIN is kicking the seat and making loud "pew-pew" laser noises. MIKE pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to find a silent corner of his mind that no longer exists.)**

**(MIKE is squished in a middle seat. To his right is DORIS, a sweet-faced grandmotherly type who has not stopped talking since takeoff.)**

**DORIS**
...and so my third husband, Herb, he had this bunion, you see, looked just like a map of Idaho. He was very proud of it. Said it gave his foot character. Are you a character person, dear?

**MIKE**
(Muttering)
I'm becoming one against my will.

**(To Mike's left is KAI, a guitarist in his early twenties with a beat-up guitar case propped by his legs. He’s incredibly chill, strumming a silent pattern on his jeans.)**

**(A few rows ahead, AGNES, a woman with wild eyes and a death grip on her armrests, flinches at every tiny bump.)**

**AGNES**
(To no one)
Did you feel that? That was a dip. A definite dip. The left wing is loose, I can feel it in my fillings. We’re all going to be fish food!

**(Across from her, TIFFANY, an influencer, is filming herself with a ring light attached to her phone.)**

**TIFFANY**
(To her phone)
Hey, jet-setters! So, like, the turbulence is totally messing with my aura right now, but we are *manifesting* a safe and super-cute landing in Miami! Use my code "FLIGHTRISK" for 15% off your next anxiety smoothie!

**(The plane gives a sudden, sharp jolt. Several things happen at once: KEVIN’s soda goes flying. The BABY’s wail hits a new octave. The SNORING MAN snorts himself awake, looks around bewildered, and goes back to sleep. AGNES lets out a blood-curdling shriek.)**

**AGNES**
THIS IS IT! THE ENGINE FELL OFF! I KNEW IT! TELL MY CATS I LOVED THEM MORE THAN THE DOG!

**KAI**
(Leaning over Mike, towards Agnes)
Whoa, easy there, soul sister. It’s just the sky doing a little dance. Like a... cosmic mambo.

**(He pulls his guitar from its case.)**

**MIKE**
You can't do that.

**KAI**
Crisis calls for a calming melody, my friend.

**(Kai begins to softly strum a gentle, bluesy riff. It’s surprisingly soothing. Nearby, two elderly women, MARTHA and ETHEL, who have been competitively knitting the same scarf pattern, nod in appreciation. A man in a suit, BRAD, talking loudly into his AirPods, glares at Kai.)**

**BRAD**
(Into his phone)
No, you leverage the assets, Derek! Leverage them! I don't care if there's a hippie trying to start a jam session, just—

**(The plane LURCHES violently again. This one is serious. A few bags pop out of the overheads. A man in a tinfoil hat, GUS, grins.)**

**GUS**
(To the woman next to him)
Chemtrails. They’re activating the chemtrails. It’s a mind-control frequency.

**AGNES**
(Hyperventilating)
WE'RE GOING DOWN! WE'RE SPIRALING! I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE! LEO DICAPRIO DOESN'T MAKE IT!

**(The "Fasten Seatbelts" sign pings on. The cabin lights flicker. The intercom crackles to life. A shaky voice comes on. It's BRENDA, the flight attendant.)**

**BRENDA (V.O.)**
(Voice trembling)
Folks... uh... this is your flight attendant, Brenda. We've... we’ve hit a patch of... of unexpected turbulence. Please return to your seats and... and fasten your seatbelts. And your... your emotional seatbelts.

**(There's a sniffle over the intercom. The professionalism in her voice evaporates.)**

**BRENDA (V.O.)**
(Weeping now)
Just like Chad hit a "patch of unexpected turbulence" in our relationship! He said he needed space! Space! We live in a 700-square-foot apartment, Chad, where were you going to find space?!

**(The entire cabin goes silent, save for the engine hum and the baby, who has quieted, listening intently. Mike’s eyes are wide with disbelief.)**

**DORIS**
(Whispering to Mike)
Oh, dear. This happened with my second husband, Gary. Men and their "space."

**BRENDA (V.O.)**
(Full-on breakdown)
He said it wasn't me, it was him! But he took the air fryer! The good one! The one my mother got us for our anniversary! You don't take the air fryer if it's "not about me," Chad! You just... you just don't! He left a note on a crumpled napkin and took the crisper tray of my heart with him! So please, for the love of God, stay seated! Because I can’t handle another thing flying apart in my life right now!

**(The intercom cuts off with a loud SQUELCH. A profound, stunned silence hangs in the air for a solid ten seconds. The plane steadies.)**

**(Kai stops strumming. He looks at his guitar, then plays a single, mournful blues note that hangs in the air.)**

**KAI**
Heavy.

**(Agnes is now perfectly still, her fear momentarily replaced by empathetic shock.)**

**AGNES**
He took the air fryer? That monster.

**(Mike slowly puts his head in his hands. He takes a deep, shuddering breath, then looks up, a strange, serene calm washing over his face. He has broken through the other side of sanity.)**

**MIKE**
(To the universe)
You know what? This is fine. Everything is fine.

**(He leans his head back and closes his eyes, a tiny, unhinged smile on his lips. The baby starts crying again.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**

**Title: The Great Getaway**

**Setting: A small campground under a starry sky. Two tents are pitched awkwardly in the middle of a clearing, surrounded by trees. A small fire crackles in the center. The scene is dimly lit, with the occasional rustle of leaves hinting at unseen creatures.**

**Characters:**
1. **ZOEY** - The adventurous leader. Confident, always seeking an adrenaline rush.
2. **JENNA** - The worrier. Cautious and quick to raise concerns.
3. **LILA** - The peacemaker. Calm and diplomatic, but a little spacey.
4. **RYAN** - The jokester. Always has a witty remark, rarely serious.
5. **MARCUS** - The planner. Logical, detail-oriented, but constantly anxious.
6. **LOGAN** - The reluctant participant. Easily scared and reluctant due to his fear of wildlife.

**[The scene opens with the friends sitting around the campfire. ZOEY is poking at the fire while everyone else is huddled in blankets.]**

**ZOEY:** (grinning) There! Finally, we did it. No parents, no rules. Just the thrill of nature!

**JENNA:** (wringing her hands) And mosquitoes. Lots of mosquitoes. Are you sure this was a good idea?

**RYAN:** (playfully) What's a few itchy bumps compared to the beauty of the great outdoors, Jenna? Listen... (pauses for effect) nothing but silence and utter peace.

**[Suddenly, a twig snaps nearby. LOGAN jumps up, clutching his blanket.]**

**LOGAN:** (wide-eyed) Did you hear that? It's a bear. I know it's a bear. We're all doomed.

**MARCUS:** (checking a map by the firelight) It's not a bear, Logan. We're over two miles away from any bear sightings according to the map. Oh, wait, is that north or... (flips the map)

**LILA:** (calmly) I'm sure it's just the wind or something. Let’s just enjoy our time together. We're going to have fun, remember?

**LOGAN:** Fun? I’ll have fun when I'm wrapped safely in four walls with a roof over my head.

**ZOEY:** (dismissively) Relax, Logan. Besides, things can't get any wilder than detention if we get caught.

**JENNA:** (worried) Speaking of wild, I need to... um, you know, water the trees. Again.

**RYAN:** (chuckling) That's the fifth time, Jenna. Are you hydrating the forest or something?

**[JENNA defiantly stands, grabbing a flashlight.]**

**JENNA:** It's called a small bladder, thank you very much. Be back in a flash!

**[JENNA exits with the flashlight. A moment of calm ensues, until sudden rustling grows louder.]**

**LOGAN:** (pacing) Okay, this is too much. I'm going to go check on Jenna. What if she got lost or, worse, abducted by... (whispering) raccoons?

**MARCUS:** (standing up) I'll come with you. We can scare off any creatures with... (holds up his phone playing a lion's roar).

**ZOEY:** (rolling her eyes) Oh, the mighty roar of Alexander Marcus!

**[LOGAN and MARCUS exit. Silence resettles only to be shattered by a loud sound from the phone, causing LILA to jump.]**

**LILA:** Was that... a voice?

**[An eerie glow shines from the trees. The group leans in with wide eyes as the “glow” resolves into... car headlights.]**

**ZOEY:** (scrambling) Oh no, no, no. Everyone pretend we’re bears! Quick!

**[RYAN drops to all fours, growling comically. LILA covers her face with her hands. The headlights turn off, and four adult silhouettes approach.]

**JENNA (off-stage):** (yelling) I knew this was a bad idea!

**[Parents—off-stage voices—call out.]**

**PARENT 1 (off-stage):** Zoey Anne Thompson! Get over here at once!

**ZOEY:** (whispering) This is the nightmare! Not raccoons, not bears—parents!

**RYAN (returning to his feet):** (grinning) Well, this senior trip was... unforgettable.

**[The group gathers sheepishly, facing their approaching parents. ZOEY stands defiant, a half-smile on her face.]**

**ZOEY:** So... pizza and detention back home, then? With some bear stories thrown in?

**[Lights dim as the group begins to walk out, followed closely by the indignant parents. Just before exiting, ZOEY winks at her friends.]**

**ZOEY:** (murmuring) Next time, we try the other end of the map.

**[The scene fades to black with distant chatter and good-natured laughter.]**

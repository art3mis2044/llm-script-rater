**CONFLUENCE**

*A city bus stop. Late afternoon. Thunder rumbles in the distance.*

*MAYA (20s, college student with a violin case) checks her phone anxiously. ROBERT (60s, janitor in uniform) sits on the bench, lunch pail beside him. DIANE (40s, real estate agent in a sharp suit) paces while on a call.*

**DIANE:** *(into phone)* No, the Morrison property is perfect for them— *(pause)* I don't care about the weather advisory, Jim. We close today or—

*A young boy, TOMMY (8), runs up breathlessly, school backpack bouncing.*

**TOMMY:** *(to Robert)* Mister, have you seen my mom? She was supposed to pick me up but—

**ROBERT:** Slow down, son. What's your mom look like?

**MAYA:** *(looking up from phone)* The emergency alert system just— Oh god. Category 5 tornado. Fifteen minutes out.

**DIANE:** *(dropping phone)* What?

*The sky turns an unnatural green. Wind picks up violently. Papers swirl.*

**ROBERT:** *(standing, decisive)* Everyone! The community center across the street— it has a basement. We need to move. NOW.

**DIANE:** My car's right there, I can—

**MAYA:** There's no time! We have to stay together!

*TOMMY starts crying. MAYA kneels beside him.*

**MAYA:** Hey, it's okay. We're going to be safe. What's your name?

**TOMMY:** Tommy. My mom said to wait here if we got separated. She said no matter what.

**ROBERT:** Son, we have to go.

**TOMMY:** *(backing away)* No! She said no matter what! She'll come!

*The wind intensifies. A trash can flies past. In the distance, a roar builds.*

**DIANE:** *(torn)* Kid, please— we can't—

**MAYA:** *(to Robert)* We can't leave him.

**ROBERT:** And we can't force him.

*They look at each other. The roar grows louder. MAYA drops her violin case, grabs TOMMY's hand.*

**MAYA:** Tommy, sometimes promises have to bend so people don't break. Your mom would want you safe.

**TOMMY:** *(pulling away)* YOU DON'T KNOW HER!

*DIANE makes a decision, starts running toward the community center. She stops, looks back.*

**DIANE:** I'm sorry. I have my own daughter. I'm sorry!

*She disappears. ROBERT looks between the community center and the boy. The tornado siren wails.*

**ROBERT:** *(to Maya)* You go. You're young. You have—

**MAYA:** I'm not leaving him. Or you.

**ROBERT:** Then we're all fools.

*He sits back down on the bench, puts his arm around TOMMY. MAYA sits on the boy's other side. They huddle together as debris begins to fly. The roar is deafening now.*

**TOMMY:** *(small voice)* She always comes back. Always.

**MAYA:** *(eyes closed, holding him tight)* I know.

**ROBERT:** *(looking at the approaching darkness)* Some of us are storms. Some of us are shelters. *(pause)* And some of us are just the space between.

*The lights flicker wildly. In the chaos, we see a figure running toward them through the debris — a WOMAN, calling out, but we can't hear her over the wind. TOMMY stands, reaching out—*

**TOMMY:** MOM?!

*Blackout. The roar consumes everything.*

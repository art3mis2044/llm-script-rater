**Title:** Platform 7
**Characters:**
*   **ANNA** (40s), a nervous woman, clutching her handbag like a shield.
*   **LEO** (17), her son. Headphones on, face buried in his phone, radiating discontent.
*   **MARCUS** (30s), a sharp-suited man, pacing and speaking into his phone's microphone.
*   **ELIZA** (70s), sitting serenely on a bench, a book in her lap.
*   **CHLOE** (20s), a street musician with a ukulele, case open for change at her feet.

**(The scene opens on a grimy, dimly lit subway platform. The air is thick with the smell of damp concrete and electricity. A digital sign flickers: "METROPOLITAN LINE – DELAYED." Water drips rhythmically from a pipe overhead into a puddle.)**

**(CHLOE is softly strumming her ukulele, a melancholic, hopeful tune that is mostly lost in the cavernous space. ELIZA watches her with a small, appreciative smile. MARCUS paces back and forth like a caged animal.)**

**MARCUS**
(Into his phone)
No, you tell Henderson that the prospectus is non-negotiable. If they can’t see the Q4 potential, that’s their liability, not mine. I’m on the train now. Almost. It’s… delayed.

**(He glares at the flickering sign as if it has personally wronged him.)**

**(ANNA and LEO stand near the edge of the platform. Anna keeps glancing from the dark tunnel to her son.)**

**ANNA**
Did you hear back from the university? You said you’d check today.

**(LEO doesn’t look up from his phone. He pulls one earbud out with a sigh of immense effort.)**

**LEO**
I’ll check later.

**ANNA**
Leo, it’s important. Your father—

**LEO**
I know what Dad wants. And I know what you want. It’s not like my opinion matters.

**(He shoves the earbud back in. The rejection is a physical blow to ANNA. She hugs her purse tighter. The low RUMBLE of an approaching train begins, but it sounds… different. Deeper. More resonant.)**

**(The lights on the platform FLICKER violently. Chloe’s song falters. She stops playing. Marcus ends his call abruptly.)**

**MARCUS**
What in God’s name…? Power surge?

**(The RUMBLE intensifies, vibrating up through the floor. It’s not the sound of wheels on a track; it’s a guttural, planetary groan. Dust and small bits of concrete begin to skitter down from the ceiling.)**

**ELIZA**
(Quietly, to herself)
Oh, my. That’s not a train.

**(A sudden, piercing high-pitched WHINE slices through the air. Everyone claps their hands over their ears. LEO rips his headphones off, his face a mask of shock and pain.)**

**LEO**
Mom? What is that?

**(Before ANNA can answer, a brilliant, silent flash of blinding white light floods the station from the street-level grates above. It’s not an explosion, but an instantaneous, unnatural daylight that erases all shadows. For a single, beautiful, terrifying second, everyone is a stark silhouette.)**

**(Then, the world breaks.)**

**(A violent, bone-jarring JOLT throws everyone off their feet. The sound is deafening—a cataclysmic CRACK, like the sky itself has split open. The overhead lights shatter. The platform heaves.)**

**(Chaos. Screams echo in the sudden darkness, which is then replaced by the hellish, pulsing red of emergency lights. A huge section of the ceiling on one end of the platform collapses, sending up a thick cloud of dust and blocking the main stairwell.)**

**MARCUS**
(Scrambling up)
The exit! It’s gone!

**(People are panicking, running towards the far end of the station. Through the dust, headlights appear in the tunnel. A train, sparks flying from its wheels, screeches onto the track on the OPPOSITE platform. Its doors slide open, automated and ghostly.)**

**ANNA**
(Grabbing for Leo)
Leo! The train! We have to cross! It’s a way out!

**(She yanks his arm, pulling him toward the tracks. But LEO stands frozen, staring not at the train, but back at the tunnel their train was supposed to come from. A strange, steady wind is now blowing OUT of it.)**

**LEO**
No… Mom, wait. The pressure is changing. If we go down the tunnel… we might get to the maintenance shafts. It could lead to the surface.

**ANNA**
(Hysterical)
Are you insane? There’s a train right there! It’s our only chance! Leo, please!

**(She tries to pull him, her face a mess of terror and desperation. People are already scrambling across the tracks to the waiting train. Chloe is helping a fallen Eliza to her feet.)**

**LEO**
That train is going deeper into the city! What if it’s worse down there? This way… this way is an unknown. It’s a real chance.

**(This is their entire conflict laid bare. Her clinging to the prescribed route, his desperate need for another way, any other way.)**

**ANNA**
I am not losing you in some dark tunnel! Come with me! NOW!

**(She lets go of him and takes a step onto the tracks, turning back, her hand outstretched, pleading. The train's horn BLARES, a long, mournful sound. Its doors begin to chime, preparing to close.)**

**(Leo looks at his mother’s desperate face, her hand reaching for him across the grimy rails. Then he looks into the gaping, windy darkness of the other tunnel. A choice.)**

**LEO**
I’m sorry.

**(He turns and sprints, not toward her, but into the darkness of the empty tunnel. He is swallowed by it almost instantly.)**

**ANNA**
LEO!

**(Her scream is raw, animalistic. Marcus, already on the train, pulls her aboard just as the doors hiss shut. Anna slams her hands against the dirty glass, her face contorted in a silent scream. She can see nothing but the empty platform and the black maw of the tunnel that took her son.)**

**(The train lurches forward, pulling her away into one darkness, while he has chosen another.)**

**(The red emergency lights on the platform flicker one last time, and then go out.)**

**(BLACKOUT.)**

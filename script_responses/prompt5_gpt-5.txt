Characters:

- Patty Panic (a terrified flyer)
- Chad Strings (laid-back guitarist)
- Earl (conspiracy guy)

Setting: The cabin of a plane in flight. Seatbelts are on. Overhead bins rattle. A baby cries intermittently.

(Lights up. The plane hums. A DING. A BABY wails. MIKE sits squished between CHAD STRINGS and PATTY PANIC. PATTY white-knuckles the armrests. CHAD lazily strums an unplugged travel guitar.)

Mike (to audience): I’m seventeen. I survived two layovers, three granola bars, and one grandma who packs goodbye Tupperware like it’s a competitive sport. California to Florida. I thought the worst part would be saying bye to her banana bread. Then we took off.

Patty: We are not meant to be in the sky. Birds are meant to be in the sky. We are meat with keys.

Chad (grinning): Relax, Patty. We’re just, like, surfing the air. It’s all vibes.

Patty: Vibes do not hold up a three-hundred-ton tube, Chad. Physics does. Does the pilot have an A in physics? Does he have an A in anything?

(Another DING. SKYLER strides down the aisle, smile a little too bright.)

Skyler (on intercom): Good afternoon, passengers. This is your flight attendant, Skyler. On behalf of the crew, welcome aboard Flight 594 to— (her voice catches) —sunny Florida.

(The plane jostles. The BABY shrieks. EARL leans into the aisle, peering toward a window.)

Earl: That’s not turbulence—that’s the government testing wing wigglers.

Dolores (waving a floral sachet): I have a calming blend, everyone. Lavender, bergamot, and acceptance. Have a sniff.

Mike (sneezing): I accept that my nose hates Florida already.

(From Row 7, JUNIPER the mime is silently trapped in a shaking box, slamming into invisible walls, eyes huge with mock-horror. ZANE swings his arms in VR land.)

Zane (to nobody): Dragon up twelve o’clock—shield, shield! Bro, I told you: switch to stealth mode!

(YOGA BRENDA stands in the aisle, attempting a wobbly tree pose as the plane vibrates.)

Yoga Brenda: Everyone, breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Think of your spine as a cloud.

Patty (hyperventilating): Clouds can’t hold spines, Brenda!

(MR. PICKLES produces a silk scarf from his sleeve, then five more, all knotted together.)

Mr. Pickles: Observe—my patented Endless Scarf of Distraction. When the scarves end, the flight turbulence will end.

Felix (scribbling in a tiny notebook): “O peanut bag of salted sorrow, crinkling in the roar—”

Skyler (on intercom, voice wavering): We’ll be coming through the cabin shortly with beverages— (She stops, inhales.) Also—and I know this is unorthodox—I feel like transparency is important for safety. (She laughs a brittle laugh.) My boyfriend—my ex-boyfriend—said he needed space. I work at 35,000 feet. Space is my office.

(The cabin murmurs. MIKE blinks at the intercom speaker.)

Patty: She’s talking about space in the sky. Why would she do that? We are in the sky.

Chad (soft chord): Let it out, Skyler.

Skyler (on intercom): We met on a layover in Phoenix. He said we fit together like puzzle pieces. Then, last week, at Gate 12, he said he found a corner piece. With “clear edges.” I was like, “Is that even a metaphor?” He left me with a cinnamon roll and a carry-on that still smells like his cologne and sandalwood soap. I can’t even look at a candle aisle. Anyway, please secure your tray tables.

(The BABY wails louder. EARL nods, vindicated.)

Earl: Distraction tactics. They make the attendant emotionally vulnerable so we don’t notice the wing wigs.

Juniper (mimes a wing snapping. Everyone groans at her.)

Zane: Uh, my dragon is clipping through the fuselage.

Yoga Brenda: Clipping is okay. We are all bodies passing through experience.

Patty: Bodies should stay on the ground! We have ankles for a reason!

(MIKE checks his phone. No service. He gazes at the ceiling.)

Mike (to audience): Grandma said, “The world is a crowded bus, kiddo. Find a window and breathe.” This bus has wings and a yoga class.

(DOLORES waves her sachet under PATTY’s nose. PATTY bolts upright, eyes watering.)

Patty: Is this—what is this—is this acceptance? It smells like a garden had feelings.

Felix (reading): “O legume of destiny, hush this infant’s lament with your humble crunch.” How do we feel?

Chad: Add “saline kiss of sky.”

Felix: Brilliant.

(MR. PICKLES drops a card deck. Cards scatter like confetti. He dives for them, pops up with a rabbit peeking from his jacket.)

Mr. Pickles (whispering): Hush, Cynthia. Emotional support.

Skyler (on intercom, voice cracking): I booked a nonrefundable condo for us in Tampa. It has a mural of flamingos. I bought matching flamingo towels. I have… flamingo towels in my trunk. He saw them and said, “I don’t want to be a flamingo.” Who doesn’t want to be a flamingo? They stand on one leg and mind their business! We will be encountering some light to moderate heartbreak— (She winces.) —turbulence. Turbulence.

(The plane lurches hard. Everyone jolts. The BABY launches into operatic crying. Overhead bins rattle.)

Mike: Okay! That was a drop. That was a legitimate drop.

Patty (clutching MIKE’s hand): If we go down, tell Florida I said no hard feelings.

Mike: Florida doesn’t text me back, ma’am.

Chad (strumming calm chords): This is the part of the song where the drums go wild and then the bass brings you home. We’re the bass, dudes.

Earl: If we tilt twelve degrees, the wing wigglers disengage. Trust me. I read a blog.

Juniper (miming handing MIKE an invisible parachute.)

Mike: If it’s invisible, does it still work?

Juniper (shrugs, mimes zipping him up, gives a thumbs-up.)

Yoga Brenda (now in child’s pose in the aisle): We surrender to the carpet.

Zane (yelping): The dragon just breathed turbulence! Five stars, would not recommend.

Dolores (to Baby, cooing): Little star, inhale lavender acceptance—

(The BABY hiccups, sniffs, quiets for half a second, then wails anew.)

Skyler (nearer now, not on intercom, eyes glistening): Hi there. Snacks?

Felix (popping up): May I debut an ode in exchange for pretzels?

Skyler (deadpan): If it’s under eighteen syllables. House rule.

Felix: “Crunch cures chaos.”

Skyler: Pretzels for poetry. (She hands him a bag, looks at MIKE.) How you doing, kid?

Mike: I’ve been worse. One time my grandma made me watch a six-hour documentary about mushrooms.

Skyler (cracking a smile): Mushrooms listen better than men. Oh God. I’m sorry. I promised myself no more public oversharing.

Chad (gentle riff): Honesty’s the real carry-on.

Patty: Can honesty land a plane?

Skyler (exhales, then snaps back into professional mode): Seatbelts fastened. We’re all going to be fine. We are. (She looks like she doesn’t believe herself, then taps the intercom.) Folks, this is Skyler again. We’re hitting a pocket of air that’s less… supportive. Like my ex. But it’ll pass. It always passes. Experiencing discomfort doesn’t mean disaster; it means you’re between places. And— (She swallows.) —sometimes you have to fly through the messy middle to get home.

(A beat. The plane continues to tremble, then eases slightly. The BABY’s cry fades to a whimper. A collective breath releases.)

Earl (softly): Huh. Wing wigglers recalibrated.

Juniper (mimes wiping sweat from brow, applauds silently.)

Yoga Brenda (peeking up): The carpet provided.

Dolores: Acceptance is inhaled. Exhaled is fear.

Mr. Pickles (pulls a single flamingo towel from his bag, confused): Where did this—?

Skyler: Oh my God. That’s mine. I keep one in my carry-on like a… like a dare. (She laughs through a tear.) Flamingos stand in water and still keep their heads high. Look at us. Same thing.

Chad (strums a warm, lazy Florida chord): See? Bass brought us back.

Patty (still trembling, but looser): Are we… okay?

Mike: I mean, “okay” is a strong word, but we’re upright, and no wing wigglers, and I can smell Florida… which is either ocean or pretzels.

Felix (offering MIKE a bag): Crunch cures chaos.

Mike (to audience): Grandma told me I’d collect stories, not stamps. She didn’t warn me they might scream, rhyme, or smell like lavender acceptance. But she did say: if you’re lucky, there’s a person with snacks.

Skyler (on intercom, voice steady now): Ladies and gentlemen, we’re through the worst of it. Estimated arrival on time. Thank you for your patience with our temporary… turbulence. And thank you for listening to things you didn’t ask to hear. If anyone’s going through a thing, we have water, pretzels, and a really solid playlist.

Chad: I’ve got chords for heartbreak, healing, and Florida sunsets.

Patty (to MIKE, sheepish): Sorry if I crushed your hand. You can have my armrest. Forever.

Mike: Deal.

(The BABY snuffles, then giggles unexpectedly. Everyone looks at one another, surprised and a little proud.)

Earl: Government can’t engineer that.

Juniper (mimes handing the BABY an invisible balloon.)

Zane (lifting his headset, finally): Dude, did we land?

Yoga Brenda: Not yet. But we are lower in our hearts.

Mr. Pickles (produces a final scarf, offers it to SKYLER): For your flamingo. Or your tears.

Skyler (taking it): For both.

Mike (to audience, with a half-smile): Will I make it out of this sane? Ask me after baggage claim. But I think… maybe I’ll make it home.

(Lights dim as the hum steadies. A final DING. The plane continues, carrying its wacky, weary, weirdly okay cargo toward Florida.)

A cluttered attic. Dust floats in the narrow light from a small window. Boxes are stacked haphazardly; mismatched suitcases lean against an old wardrobe. A single bulb hangs from a cord. ANNA sits on the floor with a tape measure and a box of labels, carefully arranging items. LEO perches on a trunk, swinging his legs, humming a tune he keeps forgetting.

ANNA
(reading a label)
“Winter linens.” “Photos, old.” “Miscellaneous.” God, I hate “miscellaneous.”

LEO
That’s the best category. It’s where treasure lives.

ANNA
It’s where things go to die. Move those quilts to the left. I need a clear path.

LEO
(salutes with two fingers and heaves a pile of quilts)
Aye, captain of the attic.

He drags something wooden from beneath the quilts. It’s an ornate box, about the size of a bread loaf, dark wood with inlaid swallows and tiny copper feet. He sets it between them with a flourish.

LEO
And behold—miscellaneous delivers. Ta-da.

ANNA
(hesitates, softening despite herself)
It’s... pretty.

LEO
It’s gorgeous. It’s like the kind of thing pirates fight over, but with better taste.

ANNA
Don’t— Just don’t scratch it.

LEO
I’m not a raccoon. (He runs his fingers over the carvings.) Swallows. She loved birds.

ANNA
(keying a label absentmindedly)
“Carved box, inlaid.” For the inventory.

She tries the lid. It doesn’t budge. She checks the front. There’s a small brass keyhole shaped like a leaf.

LEO
Locked. Of course.

ANNA
We’ll find the key.

LEO
Or we could—hear me out—break it open.

ANNA
No.

LEO
Just a little persuasion. Screwdriver. Hammer. My thumb. I have excellent thumbs.

ANNA
We are not breaking it. It’s probably older than both of us combined. Look at the joinery—dovetails. Somebody made this by hand.

LEO
Someone also made a lock by hand. Which is rude.

ANNA
She locked it for a reason. That means we unlock it for a reason. Correctly.

LEO
“Correctly.” Will the Attic Board of Standards dock us points?

ANNA
Leo.

LEO
Alright, alright. We look for a key. In a room full of keys. This is fine. I love scavenger hunts.

ANNA
She did too.

They both fall quiet for a beat. The bulb hums.

LEO
Remember the birthday she drew a map of the house and made us find our gifts? I dug up half the garden before realizing the X was a stain.

ANNA
We had to replant those peonies.

LEO
She never even got mad. She said, “Paths are only paths once you’ve walked them.”

ANNA
And then she made us clean the trowel for twenty minutes.

LEO
(laughing)
The woman believed in consequences.

ANNA
And in proper storage. The key will be—(she looks around, scanning)—not obvious. But not impossible.

LEO
So, basically, everything in here.

He hops down, starts opening tins. ANNA moves methodically, checking drawers, feeling under lids, peeking into a teacup full of safety pins.

ANNA
Button tin?

LEO
Button tin.

He opens a round tin labeled “Buttons” in careful cursive. It is a chaos of buttons, thimbles knocking against each other like teeth.

LEO
(tossing it gently)
No key. But I found a great costume for an octopus.

ANNA
Try the tins that say “Nails.” She wrote “Nails” on everything that was not nails.

LEO
(squints at a rusted tin)
This one says “String.”

ANNA
Then it’s probably marbles.

LEO
Or secrets. (He opens it. It’s full of marbles.) Ladies and gentlemen, my sister, the oracle.

ANNA
I am a licensed architect. I know how to read a structure.

LEO
Let your structure read this.

He brings the box closer. ANNA picks it up, turns it over. The brass feet catch the light. She runs a fingernail along the seam.

ANNA
See—these aren’t factory-made. There’s a... is that a mark on the bottom? (She squints.) Initials. G.M.

LEO
Grandma Margaret.

ANNA
Or Great-grandfather Michael. He made the cabinet in the dining room. The dovetail angles match.

LEO
(leaning over her shoulder)
You can tell the angle?

ANNA
You can tell a lot if you pay attention.

He tries the lid again. It doesn’t move. He makes a face at it.

LEO
You’re withholding, box. Rude.

ANNA
Don’t talk to it like—

LEO
(lightening)
Everything responds to kindness, even wood.

He strokes the box as if it were a cat. ANNA tries not to smile.

ANNA
Look at the swallows. They’re all flying toward the keyhole, except—this one.

LEO
The rebel swallow.

ANNA
It’s pointing here. (She presses on a tiny sliver of inlay near the back.) There’s a give.

LEO
Hidden latch?

ANNA
Maybe. But it’s not moving.

LEO
Ok. I’m going to check the wardrobe. If I’m not back in five minutes, I’ve been spirited away by a moth.

He crosses to the wardrobe, opens it. Inside are dresses in garment bags, a hatbox, a tin clearly labeled “Nails” with a strip of tape.

LEO
(skeptical)
She double-labeled it.

ANNA
Which means it’s not nails.

LEO
I adore her. (He opens it. He gasps dramatically.) Who’s your oracle now?

He turns, holding up a cluster of keys on a faded ribbon, each one a different size and metal, clinking like wind chimes.

ANNA
Careful. Don’t lose them.

LEO
Lose them? I’ve found my purpose.

They sit together, the box between them. ANNA takes one key, then another, tries them. The first is too big. The second won’t go in. The third fits halfway, then sticks.

ANNA
No. No.

LEO
Goldilocks would be so bored.

ANNA
(clicks her tongue)
Not this one. Not this one either. Why keep so many keys?

LEO
She was a collector of second chances.

ANNA
That’s not a thing.

LEO
It is if you make it.

He picks up a peculiar key: short, flat, with a square end.

LEO
Looks like a toy.

He tries to fit it in the keyhole. It doesn’t go. He flips it, tries the other way. No luck. He sighs, then idly touches one of the copper feet.

LEO
Ow! That foot has a bite.

ANNA
What?

LEO
It’s got a little—groove. Like a screwdriver slot.

ANNA
Let me see.

She takes the box, examines the foot. Indeed, there’s a narrow slot in the top of the foot, almost invisible unless you know to look. She takes the square-ended key from LEO, aligns it with the slot, twists. The foot turns.

LEO
No way.

ANNA
(wary excitement)
Hidden fastener.

She unscrews the foot. Inside the hollow post, nestled like a secret, is a tiny brass key tied with red thread.

LEO
She hid a key inside the foot of the box. That’s... that’s peak Grandma.

ANNA
(smiles despite herself)
It’s clever. And—it’s kind of funny.

LEO
Like her.

ANNA
(suddenly, softer)
I guess I wanted there to be a system I could follow. A plan. And there isn’t. Not really.

LEO
There is. It’s just left-handed.

She holds the tiny key between her thumb and forefinger. Her hands shake.

ANNA
You open it.

LEO
No. You should.

ANNA
You wanted to break it open five minutes ago.

LEO
You wanted to do it right.

He places his hand lightly over hers for a moment, then withdraws it. ANNA breathes, steadies herself, guides the key into the leaf-shaped hole. It slides in as if it remembers. She turns it. A small, satisfying click.

They both lean forward. ANNA lifts the lid. The smell of lavender and old paper unfurls.

Inside: a stack of letters tied with blue ribbon, a pressed sprig of something, a photograph of a young woman on a bicycle with the world ahead of her, a brooch shaped like a swallow, and an envelope addressed in familiar cursive: For when dust and light dance together.

LEO
(reads the envelope aloud, smiling)
For when dust and light dance together.

ANNA
That’s... now.

LEO
Should we—?

They look at each other. ANNA nods. She opens the envelope and pulls out a note. Her eyes flick across the words. She laughs once, a tiny, surprised sound, and then her face changes, soft and wet.

LEO
What does it say?

ANNA
(voice barely above a whisper)
“Don’t break what brought you together; press on it gently until it gives.”

LEO
She wrote us a riddle to the very last.

ANNA
(another breathless laugh)
And there’s more. “P.S. For the architect: not everything has to be measured. For the boy with light in his shoes: not everything is a shortcut.”

LEO
Her pen was a scalpel.

ANNA
There’s a line—“Keep each other.” That’s all it says at the end. “Keep each other.”

LEO
We can try.

They sit quietly, the box open between them. The bulb hums, the dust dances. LEO picks up the swallow brooch, turns it over. ANNA smooths the letters.

LEO
I still think I could’ve opened it with my thumb.

ANNA
Don’t ruin it.

LEO
I’m not. I’m celebrating my restraint.

ANNA
(smiles)
I am... proud of you, actually.

LEO
I am proud of your dovetails.

ANNA
That’s not how that works.

LEO
Everything responds to kindness. Even architects.

ANNA
And brothers.

He leans against her shoulder, just for a moment. She lets him. Then she picks up a pen, writes a new label.

ANNA
(saying as she writes)
“Swallows.” No— “Treasures.”

LEO
“Keep each other,” maybe.

ANNA
We don’t have a category for that.

LEO
We do now.

Lights dim as the dust and light keep dancing above the open box.

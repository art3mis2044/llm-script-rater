A cluttered attic. Late afternoon light sneaks in through a small window, catching dust like confetti. Boxes tower in precarious stacks. A broken lamp. A sewing machine covered by a crocheted shawl. A metal cookie tin. The smell of cedar and mothballs.

ANNA, hair tied back, sleeves rolled, a notepad and roll of blue painter’s tape in hand, kneels by a box labeled “photos???” She is making neat labels, then pulling them off, then reapplying straighter. LEO, in a moth-eaten cardigan he’s just found, wears three hats at once and a string of plastic pearls.

Leo lifts a cracked compact mirror and winks at himself.

LEO: If the pearls are haunted, do I become fancy or possessed?

ANNA: (without looking) Both, Leo. The ghost of good taste.

LEO: I’ll take it.

He drops his hats atop a teetering stack. They slide off in slow motion.

ANNA: Careful.

LEO: The hats wanted to be free.

ANNA: Nothing up here wants to be free. Everything wants to fall on my face.

LEO: Everything is a deliberate avalanche of memory. (He picks up a snow globe, shakes a yellowed storm to life.) Minneapolis in a blizzard, circa forever.

ANNA: If we keep getting distracted, we’re never going to finish. Mom wants the trunk by tomorrow.

LEO: Mom wants the trunk and your tax receipts from 2012 and for me to call Aunt Denise about the cat. It’s a rich tapestry of wanting.

ANNA: (sighs) Tape. Label. Stack. Donate. Keep. Toss. It’s not complicated.

LEO: That is your religion.

He lifts a quilt and something wooden peeks from beneath. He kneels, clears more fabric, and reveals an ornate wooden box about the size of a shoebox. It’s dark with age, decorated with a mother-of-pearl hummingbird inlaid in the lid. A small brass lock sits at the front like a closed eye.

LEO: Well hello, mystery.

ANNA: Huh.

Leo lifts it with a reverent little puff of effort. It’s heavier than it looks.

ANNA: Careful.

LEO: You like telling me “careful.”

ANNA: It’s like telling a candle “fire.”

LEO: (grinning) Don’t worry. I’m— (He jiggles the brass lock.) Locked. Of course.

ANNA: (crossing over) It’s pretty. Grandma loved hummingbirds.

LEO: Remember how she’d sit on the porch with that red feeder and say she felt like a traffic controller?

ANNA: “Runway three, please. No buzzing.” (She sets her notepad aside, runs a finger over the inlay.) It’s beautiful craftsmanship.

LEO: So how do we get it open?

ANNA: You find the key.

LEO: Or—hear me out— (He looks around for a suitable tool.) Modern problems, modern solutions.

ANNA: Leo.

LEO: I’m not saying sledgehammer. I’m not a monster. Just… do we have a butter knife?

ANNA: You don’t pry open an heirloom with a butter knife.

LEO: It’s a democratic utensil.

ANNA: It’s a lock.

LEO: (putting his ear to the box) If I listen hard enough, maybe it will tell me its secrets.

ANNA: Or you’ll hear wood.

LEO: Shhh. (He taps it. It gives a soft, padded thud.) There’s definitely something in there.

ANNA: We should find the key. She would have kept it close by. Grandma didn’t lose things. She hid them.

LEO: She also opened jars with a shoe. I’m allied with her spirit.

ANNA: (straightening) We’ll look. Systematically. Drawers first.

LEO: (hoisting the box onto a rickety table) Or—and I’m just throwing vibes—maybe the experience of not knowing is part of the adventure, right? We could… break it open and accept whatever chaos pours out.

ANNA: Chaos is not an inheritance.

LEO: It’s not not.

ANNA: Please. Five minutes. If we don’t find it, I’ll— (She makes a face, compromising with difficulty.) I’ll consider… improvised methods.

LEO: You’ll consider the butter knife.

ANNA: I will consider the existence of butter knives.

LEO: Deal. Timer?

She pulls out her phone, sets it for five minutes, and wedges it into a ceramic mug shaped like a pheasant. The soft ticking fills the space between them.

ANNA: Start with the sewing machine. She kept small things in the drawers.

LEO: The one with the terrifying foot pedal? Got it.

They split. Anna opens drawers, pulls out spools of thread, old receipts, a heart-shaped pincushion. Leo rummages through a basket of scarves, wraps one around his head like a pirate, then roots through a metal cookie tin. It’s full of buttons.

LEO: Ah yes, the cookie tin that never contained a cookie.

ANNA: (smiles despite herself) Jesus, those buttons.

Leo lifts handfuls, letting them rain down with satisfying clicks.

LEO: You think Grandma ever used half of these?

ANNA: She liked having extra.

LEO: Subtext noted. (He peers under the buttons.) No key. Just… one weird Monopoly top hat and a Canadian nickel.

ANNA: Check the lid. She taped things to the underside of lids.

LEO: (flipping the lid) Spider. Nope. One faded sticker of… Garfield? Profound.

ANNA: (finds a small envelope) “Receipts, roof.” She wrote specific labels. You could learn from this.

LEO: I label my plants with names like Craig.

ANNA: Which is profoundly unhelpful.

LEO: It helps Craig.

The timer ticks. Dust dances. The attic creaks, settling.

ANNA: (muttering) Where would she— She put the skeleton key to the basement in the sugar canister.

LEO: And the spare front door key in the hollow duck. That duck still terrifies me.

ANNA: So what’s the attic equivalent of sugar?

LEO: Memory? String? The place your hands go on autopilot. She always baked up here.

ANNA: She didn’t bake up here. She… (She hesitates, then smiles.) She cut out recipes up here. The clippings.

LEO: Recipe box!

He dives toward a wooden recipe box perched on a shelf. He pulls out cards written in their grandmother’s looping hand.

LEO: “Lemon bars.” “Beef stew, Ruth’s.” “Anna’s birthday cake.”

ANNA: (softening) The one with the ridiculous sprinkles. Keep those.

LEO: “Patience Pie.”

ANNA: That’s not a real pie.

LEO: It says: “Patience Pie—ingredients: time, breath, a kindness you extend to yourself. Directions: do not preheat. It takes as long as it takes.”

They both pause. The timer keeps ticking.

ANNA: She wrote recipes for feelings.

LEO: I like her even more.

ANNA: Check inside the box.

He does. It’s empty except for a folded note and, tucked under the cardboard lining, a flat something.

LEO: (reading) “To my hummingbirds: One who hovers, one who darts.” That’s us, huh.

ANNA: (waits)

LEO: “If you are reading this, you are being watched very carefully by a lot of dust. Please open the box together. And please—do not break it. Love makes enough cracks.”

They glance at each other, a small admission in Anna’s eyes.

LEO: She’s onto me.

ANNA: She’s onto both of us.

Leo peels back the lining. There’s a paperclip. He lifts it. Beneath is a tiny key, old brass, with a round head like a coin. He holds it up like it’s caught the last ray of the afternoon.

LEO: Boom. Patience pie.

ANNA: (exhales, a quiet laugh) Five minutes and thirty seconds.

LEO: Time is a social construct.

ANNA: Bring it here.

He crosses to the table. They stand over the box. The hummingbird gleams faintly, its inlay beak pointing at the lock. The timer pings, done. Leo reaches with the key, then stops.

LEO: You should.

ANNA: You found it.

LEO: We found it. (He dips his head.) You need to.

ANNNA: (corrects herself) Okay. Together. Your hand, mine.

They both grasp the key. Their knuckles bump. Leo’s fingers are ink-smudged from some long-ago pen; Anna’s nails are neat and practical and a little bitten.

They slide the key into the lock. It resists, then turns with a reluctant click. The lid releases. They lift it slowly.

Inside: tissue paper, carefully folded. A thin bouquet of dried lavender. A small brass compass, a little tarnished. A smooth river stone with a painted tiny house on it. A folded square of blue paper—no, not paper; a blueprint. Of a birdhouse. At the bottom, an envelope.

LEO: Oh.

ANNA: Oh.

LEO: That compass looks like the one we lost at the lake.

ANNA: She must have found it.

Leo picks up the compass. The needle trembles, then settles north. He smiles, a little dazed.

ANNA: And— (She opens the blueprint.) She drafted a birdhouse. She measured it to the eighth of an inch. There are notes: “Roof angle to catch morning light.” “Perch short so cats cannot crouch.” I can build this.

LEO: She knew you’d want to.

ANNA: (flickers a laugh that is almost a cry) Of course she did.

Leo lifts the painted stone.

LEO: Look. Our old house. The crooked porch. The maple that threw all those leaves on Halloween.

ANNA: She carried it in her pocket like a world.

LEO: Oh man.

Anna opens the envelope. A letter in their grandmother’s hand.

ANNA: “My dears. If you fight about the box, I accept responsibility; I made things too nice to smash. Leo—don’t break it. Anna—don’t make him earn the key. You both have always been key-shaped. Inside is enough for each of you to hold something that points you forward. Build the birdhouse together, please; you cannot both be in the tree at once. Hang it where you can see it. The birds will come or they won’t; that’s not up to you. What is up to you is making a place for them. Love, G.”

LEO: (blinking quickly) Not fair.

ANNA: It’s exactly fair.

LEO: You crying a little?

ANNA: You crying a lot?

LEO: Always.

He laughs at himself, wipes his cheeks with the sleeve of the cardigan.

LEO: So… I’m sorry I wanted to butter-knife her legacy.

ANNA: I’m sorry I wanted to tape-label your enthusiasm.

LEO: I am enthusiastic in need of labels.

ANNA: And I am labels in need of your nonsense.

LEO: We are a balanced breakfast.

ANNA: (folding the blueprint carefully) We’ll build it on the porch.

LEO: Sunday?

ANNA: Saturday. If I don’t start, I’ll overthink it.

LEO: Saturday it is. I’ll bring snacks. And a butter knife. For… butter.

ANNA: For butter.

They sit on the dusty floor with the open box between them, the afternoon light softening. Their shoulders touch lightly.

LEO: Do you think there are more boxes?

ANNA: (glances around the attic, then at him) Maybe. But we can open this one again and again.

LEO: Look at you, being poetic.

ANNA: Don’t tell anyone.

LEO: Cross my heart.

He picks up the compass. She tucks the letter back in the envelope. The hummingbird on the box seems almost mid-flight, its little inlaid beak forever pointing somewhere just ahead.

Lights fade as they sit there, counting breath and buttons and the time they’ll make.

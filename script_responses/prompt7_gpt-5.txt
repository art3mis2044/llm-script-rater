Title: The Closing

A wind-scoured afternoon at the edge of the harbor. The sky is a bruise of low cloud, the surface of the river chopped gray. A massive steel flood barrier looms above a pedestrian walkway, a rib of industrial muscle that can swing shut to seal the city from storm surge. Gulls wheel and cry. The air tastes metallic.

KAI, a lean twenty-something on a scuffed delivery bike, rolls in, one earbud in, a thermal bag bouncing against his side. He checks his phone as he coasts.

KAI: (muttering) Five minutes late, come on. Just one star, one more—

MARTA, mid-40s, a nurse who has just stepped off a night shift, sits on a low concrete wall and rubs her eyes. She breathes in the river and exhales fatigue.

MARTA: (to herself) Stay awake long enough to get home. That's it. That's all.

ALEJO, a weathered fisherman in his sixties, in a faded cap, moves with deliberation. He carries a small tackle box and looks out at a bobbing, chewed-up boat tied nearby.

ALEJO: (to the boat) Not today, vieja. Not if they're right.

JULES, a teen in a coffee house apron knotted at the waist and a skateboard under one arm, hovers near the harbor kiosk shuttering for the day. He holds a pastry bag and a phone that won't stop buzzing.

JULES: (into phone) I'm out. Yeah—no, they sent everyone home early. Dad? ... Dad, can you hear me? It's loud.

VICTOR, in a suit with a loosened tie, storms down the path on a conference call. He speaks the language of someone who thinks his words can hold a tide back.

VICTOR: Resilience isn't a line item, it's a mindset. If we pivot now, we— hello? You cut out.

SANAA, late twenties and very pregnant, stands under the barrier’s shadow, examining the screen of her rideshare app. She pats her belly as if negotiating.

SANAA: Not today, little star. Let's keep to the calendar.

PRIYA, in an orange city engineer vest, appears near a small control booth with reinforced glass. A radio crackles in hand. She looks up at the barrier as if it could listen.

RADIO (tinny, urgent): Sector Three, confirm status. Surge models updated—twenty minutes ahead of schedule.

PRIYA: (pressing the button) Priya here. On site. It’s busy. People on the apron.

RADIO: Close now or we lose the Lower Market. Repeat, close now.

A small gust skitters a paper coffee cup along the ground. Everyone notices the sudden drop in the air's temperature. A siren bleats, distant at first, drifting downriver. Then a voice on a recorded loop: "Attention. Barrier closing. Evacuate the walkway immediately."

Victor looks around, annoyed.

VICTOR: Now? You can't close— my car's in the garage across— (into his phone) They’re closing the barrier on me. On me.

Jules's phone drops to speaker, his dad's voice thin.

DAD (on speaker): Jules? I'm two blocks away. Stay by the gate. I'll be right there. Don't go anywhere.

Jules freezes in the split between a recorded voice and a real one. He glances at the looming metal.

Kai nearly runs into Marta’s knees with his front wheel.

KAI: Sorry! Sorry— you okay?

MARTA: (smiles wryly) Define "okay."

Priya steps up onto a low barrier. She is small and impossible to ignore in her neon vest.

PRIYA: Hey! You all need to be on the city side of the barrier now. We're closing. I cannot stress this enough. Move.

Alejo squints at the water. It's inching higher, foaming around the pilings.

ALEJO: In '72 they said it wouldn't get this bad. They were liars then too.

SANAA: (grimacing, hand on belly) It's just a practice contraction.

MARTA: You sure? It looks—

SANAA: (breathing) Fine. Fine. I can make it.

Priya overhears their exchange and softens. For a second, she isn't a decision, she's a person.

PRIYA: Okay, come on. All of you. Stay together. (into her radio) I have six civilians in motion. Give me ninety seconds.

RADIO: Forty-five or we lose the window.

Victor stalks forward, tries to push past.

VICTOR: I cannot miss this. Does your supervisor know who—?

PRIYA: (without looking at him) The river doesn't care who you are.

Kai slides off his bike, guiding it alongside Jules.

KAI: You good? Need a hand?

JULES: My dad's coming. He said to wait.

Kai looks at Priya, at the gate, at the river. His phone buzzes. He flips it over. A notification: "Customer canceled order. Tip removed." Another: "Mom: You home? Flood news is scaring me."

KAI: (half to himself) Of course.

Marta takes Sanaa's elbow, the way she's done a thousand times with a patient, the muscle memory of care.

MARTA: Lean on me. Slow breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth.

Sanaa nods, metrics faltering as a real pain swells.

The siren climbs an octave, the recorded voice insists. The wind kicks something loose; a gull drops half a sandwich at Jules's feet. He doesn't move.

ALEJO: (to Priya) My boat. If I don't get her off that line, she'll smash. She's all I have left.

PRIYA: (torn) I'm sorry. I can't let you—

Alejo takes two steps toward the edge. His boot slides on algae. He pinwheels. Kai catches his arm before he goes over.

KAI: Hey— whew. Don't add swimming to your to-do list.

ALEJO: (breathing hard, embarrassed) Gracias.

In catching him, Kai's thermal bag tears, spilling containers. Soup sloshes, a lid spins in the wind, wobbles away like a coin.

Kai stares at the mess on the concrete like it's proof of something.

PRIYA: (shouting, frantic now) Go! Sanaa, is it? Go with the nurse. You three, move. Move!

Victor grabs Jules's shoulder to steer him. Jules shrugs him off with sudden heat.

JULES: Don't touch me!

DAD (on speaker, voice breaking up): Jules? I'm right here— I can see the cranes. Stay where I can find you—

Marta and Sanaa make for the city side, shuffling quick. Alejo wrestles himself upright, then, with a sigh that tastes like surrender, abandons his boat.

ALEJO: (to the water) Another time, vieja.

Victor, grumbling, moves too. He clutches at his briefcase like it's buoyant.

Kai starts to push his bike, then hears the phone again. He thumbs a quick text to Mom: "On my way. Love you." He looks at Jules, at the indecision wrapped around him like a jacket.

KAI: He's in traffic. You'll both miss it if you wait.

JULES: (eyes wet, angry at strangers, at rules) He said— he always says if I just wait—

PRIYA: (into the radio, clipped) I'm closing.

RADIO: Now. Now, Priya. Now.

Priya's hand hovers over a large, ugly red switch in the booth. She looks out. She sees a nurse who is always supposed to help, helping. An old man who looks at a boat like a spouse. A young courier with soup on his shoes. A boy who is someone's entire world. A woman about to become someone's home.

She pulls the switch.

With a groan that feels like old iron learning to sing, the barrier starts to move. It swings, slow and heavy, slicing air and light. The walkway under it dips into shadow.

VOICE (recorded, pitiless): Barrier closing. Evacuate. Evacuate.

Marta and Sanaa step through to the city side with seconds to spare, Victor on their heels. Alejo lags, one hand on his hip. Kai pushes his bike, watching Jules.

JULES: Dad!

From the city side, up the block, a figure appears—Jules's father, breathless, face red with effort, still in his work shirt with paint stains. He stops, shock in his eyes as the steel slides between them.

DAD: Jules! Don't move! I'm here.

The gap narrows. A ten-foot opening becomes eight, then six. The water slaps harder. Wind hiccups with the first cold drops of rain.

KAI: Come on. Please.

Jules steps toward the narrowing light, then steps back, tethered to the voice in his pocket. He has always been the kid at the window waiting for headlights. He has learned how waiting can be love.

PRIYA: (hand on the lever, to herself) If I stop it now— if I stop it, the markets go under. The hospital. The schools.

She does not stop it. She puts her weight into it.

Alejo reaches the threshold and turns. He holds out a hand in old-man stubbornness toward Jules.

ALEJO: Niño. Your father will find you on the other side. But you have to be on the other side.

JULES: (to the moving wall, desperate) Dad—?

DAD: Go, mijo! Go! I'm here. I'm right here. We'll— (he pounds on steel he can't outfight with hands, with promises)

Jules bolts for the city side at the last possible second. His skateboard clatters away from him, bouncing under the descending ribs of metal and disappearing into the river.

Marta lunges, catches Jules's forearm, yanks him through the narrowing space. Kai shoves his bike, its front wheel scraping paint. The barrier kisses the seat and takes a bite; the bike screams metal on metal as it sacrifices its shape for a body’s place.

Sanaa cries out—a real contraction this time—bent double, clutching the railing. Victor backs away, hands up as though innocence is something you can hold.

Alejo, slower, hits the line and stumbles. Kai grips his collar and drags. In that draft of wind and fear, lives become rope.

The final space, the last sliver of light between steel and stone, is Jules's hand reaching back without knowing why. On the far side, his father's fingers reach forward through air that is about to become wall.

They touch, for an instant—skin to skin, palm to palm through a narrowing, the pressure of "I'm here" and "I'm sorry" and "I know" all at once—then the barrier thunders into place between them.

Sound slams. The siren stutters to a lower pitch, slogging. The recorded voice repeats. The river hurls itself at the steel and howls.

On the city side, Priya leans her forehead against the cool booth glass and closes her eyes. Jules stands with his hand pressed to unforgiving metal, feeling the vibration of his father's panic on the other side. Marta puts a hand on his shoulder, the way you do in the first seconds after a fall.

Alejo straightens slowly, looking back toward a boat now gone loose in the chop, then forward to a city that may or may not remember him. Kai picks up the bent remains of his bike seat, as if it were a broken promise. Sanaa breathes in short, sharp breaths and laughs a little broken laugh that could become a sob or a baby.

Victor, silent, tucks his briefcase under his arm and stares out at the water as if it should apologize.

From the other side of the barrier, faint, muffled by inches of steel and an entire river, a man's voice tries to be louder than physics.

DAD (muffled): Jules— hey— it's okay— I'm— we'll—

The wind rises, taking the rest. The tide presses. Somewhere far off, another siren answers, and a new voice over new speakers says something no one here can hear.

Blackout.

**Title:**
**The Last Train**

**Setting:**
A dimly lit train station located in a bustling urban city, late afternoon. The sky is a sickly yellow, casting an ominous glow over the station. A storm is brewing; thunder rumbles in the distance. People hurry past, some with umbrellas, others shielding themselves with newspapers. The digital timetable flickers, half of the information missing.

**Characters:**

- **Jenna:** A single mother in her thirties, dressed in a smart business suit, clutching a tablet and suitcase.
- **Tom:** A retired school teacher, around sixty, wearing a worn-out jacket and carrying a well-loved novel.
- **Leila:** A seventeen-year-old high school student, wearing headphones and a backpack overflowing with school supplies.
- **Marcus:** A construction worker in a neon safety vest, his face smeared with dirt, nursing a coffee.
- **Announcer (V.O.):** Voice of the train station announcement system.

**SCENE:**

*The platform is crowded with commuters. JENNA is anxiously checking her watch, TOM sits on a bench flipping through his book, LEILA is tapping away on her phone, and MARCUS is sipping his coffee, looking at the darkening sky.*

**ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**  
Attention all passengers. Due to the severe weather conditions, all trains are currently delayed. Further updates will follow.

**JENNA**  
(To herself)  
Not today, not today...

**TOM**  
(Closing his book)  
Seems like we're in for quite a storm, hm? Reminds me of a story I read once...

**LEILA**  
(Looking up)  
Hope it’s not the one where everyone gets stuck forever. I’ve got places to be.

**JENNA**  
(Glancing at LEILA)  
Well, that’d be ironic. I have a presentation tomorrow morning. What’s everyone else's excuse?

**MARCUS**  
(Shrugging)  
Just finished my shift. Could do without the excitement for once.

**LEILA**  
(Sarcastically)  
At least you guys might get a paid day off. I still have math homework.

*Suddenly, a loud boom of thunder echoes, and the lights flicker. The digital timetable goes completely dark.*

**LEILA**  
(Half-joking)  
Okay, this is definitely the start of a horror movie.

**JENNA**  
(Trying to stay calm)  
Let's hope it's not one of those.

*TOM stands, looking concerned.*

**TOM**  
You know, there might be a shelter in the station. We could wait there until the storm passes.

**MARCUS**  
(Points towards an emergency sign)  
That might be the place. Should we check it out?

**JENNA**  
(Decisive)  
We should stick together. Who knows how bad it's going to get.

*They all slowly start gathering their things. As they move across the platform, the rain begins to pour heavily. Thunder and lightning illustrate the sky.*

**LEILA**  
Are you sure it’s safe? I mean, what if it floods or something?

**MARCUS**  
Better than out here. Trust me, seen plenty of high waters. As long as we wait it out, we should be fine.

*They reach the entrance to the shelter, but as they do, a low groaning sound echoes through the station, followed by the sound of rushing water. Panic starts breaking among some other stranded commuters.*

**TOM**  
(Worried)  
We should hurry.

*The group starts moving quickly towards the shelter. Just as they’re about to go in, there’s a sudden rush of people from the opposite direction. In the chaos, LEILA is momentarily separated.*

**LEILA**  
(Calling out)  
Jenna! Marcus!

**JENNA**  
(Reaching back, desperate)  
Leila!

*The crowd pushes, making it hard for anyone to move freely. Water begins to stream down the tracks. MARCUS finds a hold of JENNA.*

**MARCUS**  
(Pulling her)  
We’ve got to move, now!

**JENNA**  
(Resistant, shouting)  
Leila!

*LEILA finally breaks through the crowd but is a few steps behind. There's a tense moment of eye contact with JENNA—a brief, poignant pause amid the chaos.*

**TOM**  
(Grabbing LEILA’s hand)  
Come on, child!

*The group is finally reunited but stands at the precipice of the now flooding platform edge leading to the uncertain shelter. A heavy silence falls—the decision weighs in the air.*

**ANNOUNCER (V.O.)**  
(Electrical buzz, then static)  
...final boarding...departure...now.

*The voice fades away, leaving an unsettling ambiguity. Thunder roars louder, and the platform begins to tremble slightly.*

**MARCUS**  
(Softly)  
We can’t stay here.

*They all exchange looks, knowing they must make a choice. Yet, something is left unsaid—a fear unshared.*

*As the lights flicker one last time, the scene ends with tension hanging thick in the air, leaving their fate unknown.*

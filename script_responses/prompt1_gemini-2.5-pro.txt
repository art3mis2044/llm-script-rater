**Title:** The Last Box
**Characters:**
*   **ANNA** (30s), an architect. Dressed practically, a smudge of dust on her cheek.
*   **LEO** (30s), her brother. A musician or artist type, wearing a faded t-shirt and a relaxed demeanor.

**Setting:**
The attic of a quaint, old house. It's a kingdom of clutter, but organized clutter. Cardboard boxes are stacked neatly, some with ANNA’s neat handwriting on the side: "KITCHEN - DONATE," "BOOKS - KEEP." Shafts of dusty afternoon light cut through a grimy dormer window.

**(The scene begins. ANNA is on her knees, methodically taping up a box labeled “LINENS.” LEO is sitting cross-legged on the floor, holding an old, tarnished silver locket up to the light.)**

**LEO**
Do you think Grandma ever wore this? I can’t picture it. She was more... floral aprons and sensible shoes. Not secret-agent lockets.

**ANNA**
(Without looking up)
It probably held a picture of Grandpa. Put it in the "KEEP" pile. The small one, not the one you’ve been using for “MAYBE KEEP IF I FEEL NOSTALGIC IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.”

**LEO**
That’s a valid category. You can't just triage a life, Anna. It’s not a building site. What if we throw out the one thing that explains everything?

**ANNA**
Right now, the only thing that needs explaining is how we’re going to get this done before my car gets towed. We’re in a two-hour zone.

**(Leo sighs, placing the locket gently into a box. He rummages behind a stack of old photo albums and his hands find something. He grunts with effort as he pulls it out.)**

**LEO**
Whoa. Okay. Now this is different.

**(He places a wooden box on the floor between them. It’s beautiful and old, made of dark, polished wood with intricate brass inlays. It’s about the size of a shoebox. Anna stops taping and crawls over, intrigued.)**

**ANNA**
I’ve never seen that before. It’s gorgeous. Is it... mahogany? Look at the joinery.

**(She runs a finger along the edge, an architect's appreciation in her touch. She tries the lid. It doesn’t budge. She jiggles it.)**

**ANNA**
Locked.

**LEO**
(A wide grin spreading across his face)
The plot thickens.

**ANNA**
There must be a key. Grandma had a little tin where she kept loose keys. Did you see it? The one with the faded picture of hydrangeas on it?

**(Anna starts looking around, her focus renewed, a problem to be solved.)**

**LEO**
A key. Sure. A tiny, needle-in-a-haystack key in a house-sized haystack. Or...

**(Leo picks up a heavy, cast-iron bookend from a nearby box.)**

**ANNA**
(Eyes widening)
Leo. No. Put that down.

**LEO**
What? It’s efficient! Think of it as a skeleton key. One size fits all. We could know what’s inside in the next ten seconds.

**ANNA**
And destroy a hundred-year-old, hand-carved box in the process? Are you insane? That’s the opposite of efficiency. That’s just... brute force.

**LEO**
It’s not about the box, it’s about the story inside the box! Grandma wasn’t a box person, she was a story person. She would want us to get to the story. What if it’s pirate gold? Or love letters from a secret lover named Pierre?

**ANNA**
Her secret lover was the Tuesday crossword puzzle. The key is here, somewhere. It has to be. Everything has a system, a place. We just have to find the logic. Check that jewelry box.

**(Leo sighs dramatically, putting the bookend down but keeping it close.)**

**LEO**
Logic. Anna, we’re sitting in the attic of a woman who kept three years' worth of rubber bands in a single, tangled ball. Let’s not overstate her commitment to logic.

**(He picks up the box, shaking it gently next to his ear.)**

**LEO**
Doesn't rattle. Must be something soft. Old letters. A christening gown. A map to Atlantis!

**ANNA**
(Sifting through a tin of buttons, frustrated)
It's not in here. Look, this is an heirloom. We’re supposed to be preserving her things, not taking a crowbar to them. It’s disrespectful.

**LEO**
You know what’s disrespectful? Letting her last secret rot in a box because we were too timid to look. She was the one who taught us to climb trees to get the best apples, remember? She wasn’t afraid of a few scraped knees to get to the good stuff.

**(He looks at Anna, his tone softening.)**

**LEO**
This is the good stuff, Anna. The mystery. The one last adventure she left for us.

**(Anna stops searching. She looks at the box, then at her brother. The stress in her face gives way to a flicker of something else—weariness, maybe even curiosity. She exhales slowly.)**

**ANNA**
Okay. Fine. We’ll compromise.

**LEO**
(Leaning forward, hopeful)
We break it open gently?

**ANNA**
We look for the key for one more hour. My way. We search every tin, every drawer, every coat pocket in that wardrobe over there. Systematically. And if we can't find it...

**(She glances at the bookend, then back at him. A small, reluctant smile plays on her lips.)**

**ANNA**
...we get to the good stuff. Your way.

**(Leo’s grin returns, brighter than ever. He picks up a dusty hatbox and offers it to her.)**

**LEO**
Deal. You take the hats, I’ll take the dusty correspondence from a man named Pierre.

**(Anna takes the box, shaking her head but unable to hide her smile. For a moment, they are a team. The locked box sits between them, a silent promise.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**

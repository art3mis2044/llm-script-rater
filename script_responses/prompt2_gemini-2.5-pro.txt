**Title:** Operation Breakfast Storm
**Characters:**
*   **ANNA (40s):** The mother. A well-meaning drill sergeant whose battle plans are about to go up in smoke.
*   **MARK (40s):** The father. Trying to be helpful, which is rarely the same as being helpful.
*   **CHLOE (15):** The teenage daughter. Moves with the urgency of a hibernating sloth.
*   **LEO (8):** The son. A small, chaotic whirlwind of energy and questionable ideas.
*   **BUSTER:** A large, goofy Golden Retriever, perpetually underfoot.

**Setting:**
A lived-in, middle-class kitchen. There’s a central island counter. The fridge is plastered with school art and magnets. A coffeemaker gurgles on the counter next to a toaster. It’s 7:32 AM on a Wednesday.

**(The scene opens. ANNA is a blur of motion. She’s at the stove, flipping pancakes with one hand and pointing a spatula with the other.)**

**ANNA**
(Loudly, to the house at large)
T-minus eighteen minutes until departure! I need signed permission slips, empty lunchboxes, and fully-dressed humans in this kitchen, stat! Leo, where are your shoes?

**(LEO skids into the kitchen in his socks, wearing a pirate eye-patch and holding a half-eaten banana like a sword. BUSTER, the dog, trots happily at his heels.)**

**LEO**
I can’t find them, Captain Mom! They’ve been plundered!

**ANNA**
They’re by the back door where they always are. Mark! Is the coffee ready? I need tactical-grade caffeine!

**(MARK enters, wrestling with his tie. He’s looking at his phone.)**

**MARK**
One sec, honey, just got an urgent email from Henderson about the quarterly reports. Did you see my blue tie? The one with the little dots?

**ANNA**
It’s on your neck, Mark. Leo, shoes! Not banana-sword!

**(MARK looks down at his chest, surprised to find the tie already there. LEO ignores Anna and lunges at BUSTER.)**

**LEO**
En garde, you salty sea dog!

**(BUSTER barks happily and wags his tail, thinking it’s a game. He dodges, knocking over a half-full glass of orange juice on the floor. ANNA spins around.)**

**ANNA**
Leo! No swordplay with the dog before eight a.m.! Mark, paper towels!

**(CHLOE drifts into the room, staring intently at her phone. She’s wearing pajama bottoms and a sweatshirt.)**

**CHLOE**
(Without looking up)
Mom, I have a global crisis. My TikTok on the proper application of concealer only got, like, twelve views. My social life is over.

**ANNA**
Your social life will be over when you miss the bus because you’re not dressed. Your pancakes are on the island. Mark, are you a statue? The juice is seeping!

**(MARK, who was still mesmerized by his tie, snaps to attention and grabs the paper towels. He starts mopping up the spill.)**

**MARK**
Got it. So, Chloe, what’s a… tick-tock? Is that like a clock?

**(CHLOE gives him a look of withering pity that could curdle milk. She pokes at a pancake.)**

**CHLOE**
These are plain. I need chocolate chips. It’s an emotional support breakfast.

**ANNA**
We don’t have time for emotional support breakfast! It’s Wednesday! It’s eat-what-you’re-given-or-starve day! Leo, I am not going to tell you again—

**(The toaster pops with a violent PING! and ejects two pieces of toast that are blackened, smoking ruins.)**

**MARK**
(Waving a hand)
Whoa, toast is a little dark.

**ANNA**
(Eyes wide)
That was the last of the bread! Fine! Everyone gets pancakes!

**(Anna whirls back to the stove, but in her frustration, her elbow knocks the open bag of flour on the counter. A white cloud erupts, dusting her, the counter, and the floor. BUSTER immediately runs over and starts sniffing, then sneezes, sending a secondary puff of flour into the air.)**

**LEO**
Look! It’s snowing!

**(Leo, delighted, grabs a handful of the spilled flour and throws it in the air like confetti.)**

**ANNA**
(In a low, dangerous voice)
Leo. Do. Not.

**(Just then, the coffeemaker gives a final, loud, sputtering gasp and overflows, sending a stream of dark brown liquid across the counter, heading directly for Chloe’s phone.)**

**CHLOE**
(Screams)
My phone! It’s drowning!

**(Chloe snatches the phone just in time. Mark, trying to help, slips on the orange juice spot he missed, and pinwheels his arms, sending the soggy paper towels flying. They land with a wet smack on his quarterly report printouts sitting on the island.)**

**MARK**
My reports! Henderson will kill me!

**(A thick silence falls. Everyone is frozen. ANNA stands center-stage, lightly coated in flour, spatula in hand. LEO has a white handprint on his shirt. CHLOE is clutching her phone like a lifeline. MARK is on one knee, staring in horror at his ruined papers. BUSTER is happily licking a puddle of coffee off the floor.)**

**ANNA**
(Quietly, to herself)
Okay. New plan.

**(She takes a deep, theatrical breath.)**

**ANNA**
Nobody move. We are all calling in sick. The world can just manage without the Henderson family for one day. Leo, go find the remote.

**(Leo lets out a whoop of joy and runs out of the kitchen, slipping and sliding through the various spills. Mark slowly sits down on the floor, defeated. Chloe starts taking a selfie in the middle of the disaster.)**

**(FADE TO BLACK.)**

**SETTING:** The Brewer family dining room. A fully set Thanksgiving table. Chaos is imminent.

---

*(Lights up on the BREWER family dining room. MARGARET frantically adjusts place settings while TOM carves a turkey. LILY scrolls on her phone. A CHICKEN—GOOSE—struts across the stage.)*

**MARGARET:** Tom! Why is Goose in the dining room?!

**TOM:** *(knife mid-air)* I thought I closed the door—

**LILY:** *(not looking up)* Dad literally almost cooked Goose. Like, he had her on the counter next to the turkey.

**MARGARET:** He WHAT?

**TOM:** In my defense, they look very similar when they're both... poultry-shaped.

**MARGARET:** One is ALIVE, Tom!

*(Doorbell rings. GOOSE clucks. MARGARET freezes.)*

**MARGARET:** *(whispering urgently)* Both grandmas are here. AT THE SAME TIME. Lily, get Goose. Tom, hide the liquor from your mother and hide the vegan pamphlets from mine—

*(GRANDMA VIV bursts in wearing a bedazzled tracksuit, rhinestone sunglasses, carrying shopping bags.)*

**GRANDMA VIV:** HELLO, MY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY! *(air kisses)* Vegas was INCREDIBLE! I won $3,000 on slots, took a burlesque class, and I think I might have married someone named Tony—

**MARGARET:** You WHAT?

**GRANDMA VIV:** I'm kidding! *(pause)* Probably.

*(GRANDMA RUTH enters from the opposite side, dressed in a proper skirt suit, carrying a Bible and casserole dish.)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** *(coldly)* Vivian.

**GRANDMA VIV:** *(equally cold)* Ruthie. I see you're still dressing like it's 1952.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** I see you're dressed like a disco ball had an identity crisis.

**TOM:** Mom! Let me take that casserole—

**GRANDMA RUTH:** *(eyeing the table)* I brought my famous green bean casserole. The TRADITIONAL recipe. Not whatever organic, gluten-free nonsense was served last year.

**GRANDMA VIV:** *(pulling out a flask)* Oh please, that casserole is drier than your personality. I brought vodka-cranberry sauce. Gave it a little *pizzazz*.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** You put ALCOHOL in the CRANBERRY SAUCE?!

**MARGARET:** *(desperate)* It's Thanksgiving! Time for gratitude! Let's all just—

*(GOOSE jumps onto the table. Beat. Everyone stares.)*

**LILY:** That's Goose. She's been living in the garage since last month.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** There is a CHICKEN on the Thanksgiving table! This is sacrilege!

**GRANDMA VIV:** *(delighted)* I love it! Very avant-garde! *(pulls out phone)* This is SO going on my Instagram.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** You have an Instagram?! 

**GRANDMA VIV:** 12,000 followers, baby. I'm an influencer. #SeniorSlay #VegasGrandma

**GRANDMA RUTH:** *(clutching pearls)* This family has lost ALL sense of decorum—

**TOM:** *(trying to grab GOOSE)* Here, Goose— GOOSE, NO!

*(GOOSE flaps, knocking over the vodka-cranberry sauce onto GRANDMA RUTH'S casserole.)*

**GRANDMA RUTH:** MY CASSEROLE!

**GRANDMA VIV:** *(laughing)* NOW it has flavor!

**MARGARET:** *(snapping)* ENOUGH! 

*(Everyone freezes. MARGARET takes a deep breath.)*

**MARGARET:** We are going to sit down. We are going to hold hands. We are going to say what we're grateful for. And we are NOT going to insult each other, murder each other, or cook the pet chicken. Understood?

*(Beat. Everyone nods meekly. They sit. GOOSE settles in TOM's lap.)*

**TOM:** I'll... just hold Goose.

**MARGARET:** Fine. *(composing herself)* Now. Grandma Ruth, why don't you start us with grace?

**GRANDMA RUTH:** *(primly)* Dear Lord, thank you for this meal, and please forgive this family for its many, MANY sins—

**GRANDMA VIV:** *(muttering)* What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Ruthie.

**GRANDMA RUTH:** *(eyes snapping open)* What was that?

**LILY:** *(standing suddenly)* I'm grateful for noise-canceling headphones!

*(LILY exits. GOOSE clucks. MARGARET pours herself a large glass of wine.)*

**MARGARET:** *(to audience)* Happy Thanksgiving.

*(Blackout.)*

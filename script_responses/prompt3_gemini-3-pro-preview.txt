**Title:** Fowl Play at the Brewer Table
**Characters:**

*   **SUSAN BREWER:** (40s) The hostess. Holding on to her sanity by a very thin thread.
*   **MARK BREWER:** (40s) The husband. Trying to avoid conflict, failing miserably.
*   **GRANDMOTHER ELEANOR:** (70s) Mark’s mother. Wears pearls, drinks tea with her pinky out, and thinks fun is a sin.
*   **NANA ROXIE:** (70s) Susan’s mother. Wearing a sequined leopard-print tracksuit and oversized sunglasses. Just flew in from Vegas.
*   **GOOSE:** A plump, Rhode Island Red chicken. Not a goose.

**Setting:**
The Brewer Dining Room. It is aggressively decorated for Thanksgiving. A "GIVE THANKS" banner hangs crookedly. The table is set with fine china.

[SCENE START]

**LIGHTS UP:**

The family is seated. The tension is thick enough to cut with a carving knife. ELEANOR is inspecting her silverware with a look of profound disappointment. SUSAN is staring at the kitchen door, vibrating with anxiety. ROXIE is shuffling a deck of cards at the table, the *fwip-fwip-fwip* sound echoing loudly.

**ELEANOR**
Susan, dear, I believe this fork has a water spot. In my day, a water spot was grounds for social exile.

**SUSAN**
(Through gritted teeth)
I’ll make a note of it, Eleanor.

**ROXIE**
(Loudly)
Hit me!

**MARK**
Roxie, please. We’re about to say grace. Put the cards away.

**ROXIE**
Relax, Marky-Mark. I’m on a hot streak. I took the Bellagio for three grand at the craps table last night. You gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em!

**ELEANOR**
(To no one in particular)
It smells like cheap cigarettes and desperation in here.

**ROXIE**
And it smells like mothballs and judgment over there. At least I know how to live, Ellie. You look like you’re dressed for a funeral. Who died? Hopefully, it was your sense of superiority.

**ELEANOR**
It is called *dignity*, Roxanne. Something you left at the slot machines in 1987.

**SUSAN**
(Slams hand on table)
STOP! Both of you! Mark, go get the turkey. Now.

**MARK**
Right. The turkey. The bird. The... centerpiece.

Mark looks terrified. He stands up slowly. Suddenly, a loud *CLUCK* comes from under the table. Eleanor jumps.

**ELEANOR**
Good heavens! What touched my ankle? It felt like a feathered rat!

**ROXIE**
Don't talk about my grand-chicken like that. Come here, Goose!

ROXIE snaps her fingers. GOOSE, a very confused chicken wearing a tiny Pilgrim hat, hops out from under the tablecloth and jumps onto an empty chair.

**ELEANOR**
(Gasping)
Livestock? At the table? Susan, have you lost your mind?

**SUSAN**
He has separation anxiety, Eleanor! If we leave him in the coop, he screams!

**ROXIE**
That’s right. Goose is a high roller. He likes the VIP treatment. Here, baby, have a bread roll.

Roxie tosses a roll. Goose pecks at it aggressively, sending crumbs flying onto Eleanor’s lap.

**ELEANOR**
(Brushing off crumbs frantically)
This is an abomination! Mark, bring out the dinner so I can eat and leave before I catch salmonella or, heaven forbid, *tackiness*.

Mark enters from the kitchen. He is holding a massive silver platter with a domed lid. He looks sweaty. He places it in the center of the table.

**MARK**
Okay. So. Here’s the thing. The oven... it has a personality.

**SUSAN**
Mark, lift the lid.

**MARK**
I just want everyone to know that I tried my best.

**ROXIE**
Folding under pressure. I’ve seen it a million times. Show us the cards, kid.

Mark lifts the lid.

Underneath is a turkey that is not just burnt; it is a carbonized, shriveled meteorite. It looks like a prop from a horror movie.

Silence falls over the table. Even Goose stops pecking.

**ELEANOR**
(Dryly)
I see we are serving charcoal this evening. Is this a new trend?

**SUSAN**
(Head in hands)
Oh, god.

**ELEANOR**
Well, we cannot eat that cancer-biscuit. However... (She slowly turns her eyes toward Goose) ...we do have a perfectly fresh bird sitting right there.

**ROXIE**
(Slams cards down)
Over my dead body, you dusty old witch! Goose is family!

**ELEANOR**
He is poultry! He is food! It is the circle of life, Roxanne!

**MARK**
Mom, we are not cooking the pet! I... I actually almost did.

**SUSAN**
What?

**MARK**
When I saw the turkey was burned, I looked at Goose. I had a dark moment, Susan! I was holding the cleaver! But he looked at me with those beady little eyes, and he clucked, and I just couldn't do it!

**ROXIE**
(To Goose)
Did the bad man threaten you? You want Nana to rough him up?

**ELEANOR**
This is ridiculous. I am starving. If you won't cook the beast, I will.

Eleanor grabs a steak knife and stands up. Roxie jumps up, grabbing a ladle like a sword.

**ROXIE**
You want a piece of the bird? You gotta go through me! Vegas rules, baby! No holds barred!

**SUSAN**
SIT DOWN! BOTH OF YOU!

Susan grabs the phone from her pocket.

**SUSAN**
We are ordering pizza. Pineapple and ham.

**ELEANOR**
(Horrified)
Fruit? On cheese? That is against God’s law!

**ROXIE**
Double pineapple! And get some cheesy bread for Goose. He loves carbs.

**MARK**
(Slumping into his chair)
Happy Thanksgiving.

Goose clucks loudly, flutters up onto the table, and sits directly on top of the burnt turkey. He looks triumphant.

**ROXIE**
( raising a glass)
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

**BLACKOUT.**

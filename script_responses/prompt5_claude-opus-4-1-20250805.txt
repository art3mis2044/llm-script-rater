**FLIGHT 447: MIKE'S DESCENT INTO MADNESS**

*Setting: Interior of a commercial airplane, mid-flight. The cabin shakes with turbulence. A baby's wailing echoes throughout.*

**MIKE** *(17, exhausted, sitting in middle seat, gripping armrests)*: Just two more hours. Two more hours...

**CRAZY LADY GLADYS** *(60s, wild hair, clutching multiple crucifixes, seated next to Mike)*: WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! THE METAL DEATH TUBE IS FALLING! 

**LAID BACK GUITARIST JEROME** *(30s, dreadlocks, hemp necklace, seated across aisle)*: *Strumming guitar* Hey man, death is just another journey, you know? *Plays off-key chord*

**FLIGHT ATTENDANT BRITTANY** *(Over intercom, voice cracking)*: Ladies and gentlemen— *Sniff* —this is your flight attendant Brittany speaking. We're experiencing some turbulence, kind of like my relationship with Derek. DEREK, IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE BLACK BOX RECORDING AFTER WE CRASH, I HATE YOUR STUPID FACE!

**GLADYS**: *Grabbing Mike's arm* DO YOU SEE THE ANGELS? THEY'RE HERE FOR US!

**MIKE**: Ma'am, please—those are just overhead lights—

**CONSPIRACY THEORIST CARL** *(40s, aluminum foil visible under baseball cap, row behind)*: Lights? LIGHTS?! Those are government scanning devices! They're downloading our thoughts!

**YOGA INSTRUCTOR MOONBEAM** *(20s, doing poses in aisle)*: Everyone just needs to align their chakras! *Drops into downward dog, blocking beverage cart*

**BRITTANY** *(Intercom)*: Derek and I were supposed to go to Cabo next week. CABO! But noooo, he had to go with his "work wife" instead. WORK WIFE ISN'T A REAL THING, DEREK!

**WANNABE RAPPER LIL' TURBULENCE** *(Standing up)*: Yo, yo, yo! This turbulence got me inspired! *Beatboxing terribly* My name is Lil' T and I'm here to say—

**AGGRESSIVE BUSINESSMAN HAROLD**: SIT DOWN! Some of us are trying to close deals here! *Shouting into phone* SELL! SELL! SELL!

**VENTRILOQUIST VERNON** *(With dummy)*: 
**VERNON**: Isn't this flight wonderful, Mr. Whiskers?
**DUMMY**: I want off this plane, Vernon!
**VERNON**: Don't be silly!
**DUMMY**: I'M SERIOUS, VERNON!

**MIKE** *(To himself)*: Why didn't I just take the train?

**JEROME**: *Still strumming* You know what this plane needs? More cowbell. *Pulls out cowbell*

**BRITTANY** *(Intercom, sobbing)*: We're beginning our descent into Orlando, much like how my relationship descended into A PIT OF LIES AND DECEPTION!

**AMATEUR MAGICIAN MYSTICAL MARK** *(Approaching Mike)*: Pick a card, any card! It'll distract you from our impending doom!

**GLADYS**: DOOM! HE SAID DOOM! *Hyperventilating into paper bag*

**FITNESS INFLUENCER CHELSEA** *(Filming herself)*: Hey guys! Even at 30,000 feet, you can still get those gains! *Starts doing jumping jacks, hitting people*

**ALIEN ENTHUSIAST ZELDA** *(Pointing out window)*: Look! A UFO! We're being followed!

**JEROME**: That's just another plane, man.

**ZELDA**: That's what they WANT you to think!

**OVERSHARING GRANDMOTHER ETHEL** *(Tapping Mike's shoulder)*: You remind me of my grandson. He doesn't call anymore. Let me show you all 847 photos of my cats!

**MIKE**: *Puts head in hands* Please, someone, anyone, make it stop...

**BRITTANY** *(Intercom)*: Oh, and Derek, I'm keeping your PlayStation! *Sound of something breaking* Oops, WAS keeping.

*Plane hits massive turbulence. Everyone screams except Jerome, who laughs.*

**JEROME**: Groovy, man! It's like a free roller coaster!

**GLADYS**: *Faints onto Mike*

**MIKE** *(Looking directly at audience, breaking fourth wall)*: Note to self: Next time, Grandma comes to visit ME.

**BRITTANY** *(Intercom)*: We'll be landing in five minutes. Please return your seats to their upright position, unlike my relationship status which will forever be HORIZONTAL AND DEAD!

*Baby's crying intensifies. Cowbell clanging continues. Mike slowly puts on noise-canceling headphones and closes his eyes as chaos erupts around him.*

**BLACKOUT**

*END SCENE*

**SCENE START**

**SETTING:**
The attic of a Victorian home. It is a dust-mote kingdom of stacked chairs, moth-eaten velvet curtains, and cardboard boxes labeled in fading marker. Afternoon light creates solid beams through a circular window.

**CHARACTERS:**

ANNA (30s): Dressed in practical work clothes. She holds a clipboard like a shield. She is trying to organize chaos.

LEO (30s): Wearing a vintage top hat he found five minutes ago. He is holding a porcelain cat.

[The scene opens with ANNA furiously ticking things off her list. LEO is staring deeply into the porcelain cat’s eyes.]

ANNA
(Without looking up)
Box four. “Kitchen miscellany and linens.” Have we cleared the corner by the chimney yet?

LEO
(To the cat)
What secrets do you hold, Sir Whiskers? Were you a silent witness to the Great Gravy Spill of ‘98?

ANNA
Leo. Please. The estate sale people are coming on Tuesday. That gives us forty-eight hours to categorize seventy years of Grandma’s hoarding. Put the cat in the “Donate” pile.

LEO
“Donate”? This is an heirloom! This is history!

ANNA
It’s hideous. Chimney corner. Go.

[LEO sighs, places the cat gently on a stack of books, and shuffles over to the chimney. He starts pulling aside a heavy, dusty rug.]

LEO
You know, you’re treating this like a demolition project. It’s supposed to be a treasure hunt.

ANNA
It’s a fire hazard, Leo. I’m an architect; I know structural load when I see it, and right now, the structural load of this house is eighty percent sentimental junk.

[LEO tugs the rug free, revealing a dark alcove. He pauses.]

LEO
Ooh. Hello.

ANNA
(Still writing)
Dead mouse?

LEO
Better.

[Leo reaches into the shadows and drags out a heavy, wooden box. It is about the size of a microwave, mahogany, with intricate brass inlays and a very sturdy-looking iron padlock.]

LEO
(Blows dust off the lid)
Behold. The Ark of the Covenant. Or at least... Grandma’s stash.

[Anna stops writing. She walks over, intrigued despite herself.]

ANNA
I’ve never seen that before. Is it heavy?

LEO
(Lifting it with a grunt)
Solid wood. And listen.

[He gives it a shake. A dull, heavy *THUD-CLINK* comes from inside.]

ANNA
Careful! It could be fragile.

LEO
That didn’t sound fragile. That sounded like gold bars. Or a gun. Or... gold guns.

ANNA
It’s probably tax returns from 1982. Put it on the table. We need to inventory the exterior condition.

[Leo sets it down on a wobbly card table. He immediately starts tugging at the padlock.]

LEO
It’s locked tight.

ANNA
Obviously.

LEO
(Scanning the room)
Alright. Where’s the crowbar? I saw a rusty fireplace poker over by the wardrobe. That’ll do.

[Leo moves toward the poker. Anna steps in his path, hand raised.]

ANNA
Stop. We are not breaking it open.

LEO
Anna, look at it! It’s a mystery box in a creepy attic. The universe *wants* us to break it open. It’s standard narrative structure.

ANNA
It is an antique mahogany chest with hand-carved inlay. We are going to find the key.

LEO
(Laughing)
The key? Grandma had four thousand keys, Anna! There’s a jar of them downstairs. There’s a bowl of them in the kitchen. There are keys sewn into her coats! We’ll be ninety years old before we find the right one.

[Leo tries to side-step her. Anna mirrors his movement.]

ANNA
Then we try them all. Systematically.

LEO
(Groans)
"Systematically." You are sucking the soul out of this adventure. What if it’s letters? Scandalous love letters from a war hero? We need to know *now*.

ANNA
If we smash the lock, we devalue the box.

LEO
I don’t care about the resale value! I care about the *drama*!

[Leo grabs the heavy iron poker. He holds it like Excalibur.]

ANNA
Leo, put the poker down.

LEO
I’m just going to give the lock a little tap. A persuasive nudge.

ANNA
You have the finesse of a wrecking ball. You’ll splinter the wood.

LEO
(Positioning the poker)
One good strike. That’s all it takes. Stand back, citizen.

ANNA
Leo, I’m serious! Dad entrusted *me* to handle the inventory because he knew you’d turn this into a chaotic free-for-all.

[Leo pauses. He lowers the poker slightly. The playfulness drops from his face.]

LEO
Oh. Is that what he said?

ANNA
( softening)
He just... he wants it done right. We have to respect her things. Even the things she locked away. Maybe *especially* those things.

[Leo looks at the box, then at the poker. He sighs, leaning on the tool like a cane.]

LEO
I just... I want to find something cool, Anna. Something that isn’t just mothballs and old bills. I want to find something that proves she was... I don't know. Magic.

ANNA
(A beat of silence)
She kept every drawing you ever made, you know. They're in the flat files downstairs. That’s pretty magic.

[Leo looks at her, a small smile forming.]

LEO
Yeah? Even the one where I drew the dog with five legs?

ANNA
Especially the mutant dog.

[Anna looks back at the box. She runs a finger over the brass inlay.]

ANNA
Tell you what. We look for the key. We check the obvious places—the jewelry box, the desk, the nightstand.

LEO
And if we don’t find it?

ANNA
If we don’t find it by... (Check watch) ...dinner time? Then you can use the poker.

LEO
(Perking up)
Really? You’ll sanction the violence?

ANNA
I will supervise the violence.

LEO
(Grinning)
Deal.

[Leo sets the poker down on the table with a clang. He adjusts his top hat.]

LEO
I’ll start on the jewelry box. You check the pockets of those creepy fur coats.

ANNA
Fine. But if you find a key that looks like a skeleton, don't just jam it in. Call me.

LEO
Aye, aye, Captain.

[They separate to different corners of the attic. Anna picks up a heavy coat, grimacing at the dust. Leo starts rifling through a drawer.]

LEO
(To himself)
It’s definitely gold bars.

ANNA
(To herself)
It’s definitely tax returns.

[They both smile, just slightly, as they continue to search.]

**BLACKOUT.**

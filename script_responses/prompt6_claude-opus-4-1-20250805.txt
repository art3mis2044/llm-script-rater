**CAMPING CATASTROPHE**

*SCENE: A small clearing with two tents. It's nighttime. Dim moonlight. The sound of crickets and owls. Six teenagers sit around a struggling campfire.*

**CHARACTERS:**
- MAYA (F): Overachieving planner, clipboard in hand
- JADE (F): Instagram influencer, constantly posing
- RILEY (F): Paranoid worrywart
- CONNOR (M): Class clown, never serious
- ETHAN (M): Outdoorsy "expert" (but actually clueless)
- TYLER (M): Germaphobe with a weak bladder

**MAYA** *(checking clipboard)*: Okay everyone, according to my itinerary, we should be roasting marshmallows and sharing our college plans right now!

**CONNOR** *(holding a flaming marshmallow)*: Mine's sharing its plans to become charcoal! 

**JADE** *(posing with her phone)*: Wait, nobody move! The fire light is giving me perfect golden hour vibes! *snaps selfie* Ugh, Tyler you blinked!

**TYLER** *(fidgeting)*: Sorry, I need to pee. Again.

**RILEY**: AGAIN?! That's the fifth time! What if you get attacked by a bear while you're out there?!

**ETHAN** *(puffing chest)*: Bears? Pfft. I've wrestled three bears. The key is to make yourself look bigger. *stands up, trips over log*

**CONNOR**: Yeah, you really showed that log who's boss.

**TYLER**: Guys, seriously, I REALLY need to—

*CRACK! A branch snaps in the darkness*

**RILEY** *(jumping up)*: WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE! I KNEW IT! My horoscope said "avoid outdoor adventures!"

**MAYA**: Everyone calm down! It's probably just a squirrel.

**JADE**: A squirrel? At night? Maya, squirrels are diurnal.

**EVERYONE**: *stares at Jade*

**JADE**: What? I follow a nature photography account!

**TYLER** *(dancing)*: GUYS! BATHROOM! NOW!

**ETHAN**: Just go behind that tree, man. That's what nature intended.

**TYLER**: But... but there could be poison ivy! Or bugs! Or... or...

*GROWLING sound from the darkness*

**CONNOR** *(in spooky voice)*: Or the legendary Camp Winnipeg Wendigo!

**RILEY** *(shrieking)*: WENDIGO?! *dives into tent*

**MAYA**: Connor, stop it! There's no such thing as—

*A RACCOON waddles into the firelight, dragging their food bag*

**JADE**: Awww! It's so cute! Wait, is that our—MY ORGANIC TRAIL MIX!

**ETHAN**: I got this! *grabs stick* Back, foul beast!

*The raccoon hisses. ETHAN screams higher than RILEY and drops the stick*

**TYLER**: THE RACCOON IS BETWEEN ME AND THE BATHROOM TREE!

**CONNOR** *(laughing)*: This is better than Netflix!

*Suddenly, flashlight beams flood the campsite*

**MAYA'S MOM** *(offstage)*: MAYA ELIZABETH CHEN!

**CONNOR'S DAD** *(offstage)*: Connor, you are SO grounded!

**ALL PARENTS** *(entering, various overlapping)*: 
- "The Find My Phone app, sweetie!"
- "Did you really think we wouldn't notice six missing sleeping bags?"
- "Tyler, honey, there's a rest stop five minutes away!"

**RILEY** *(relieved)*: Oh thank god, civilization! I mean... uh... how did you find us?

**JADE'S MOM**: You livestreamed your location, sweetheart. "Secret camping trip with the squad!" Really?

**JADE** *(sheepishly)*: The content was too good not to share...

**TYLER**: Can someone PLEASE drive me to a real bathroom?!

**ETHAN'S DAD**: Son, did you just scream at a raccoon?

**ETHAN**: It was a tactical retreat!

**CONNOR**: So... same time next year?

**ALL PARENTS**: NO!

**MAYA** *(still holding clipboard)*: But I had seventeen more activities planned...

*The raccoon chittersreturns, now wearing JADE's designer headband*

**JADE**: MY GUCCI HEADBAND!

*Everyone chases after the raccoon as lights fade*

# GRILL WARS

**CHARACTERS:**
- JUDD, 40s, hotdog enthusiast, competitive
- JAGGER, 40s, burger aficionado, equally competitive  
- MAYA, 16, Judd's daughter, secretly romantic
- CONNOR, 16, Jagger's son, awkward but charming
- BETHANY, 40s, local food blogger, serving as judge

**SETTING:** A sunny afternoon at Riverside Park. Two grills are set up about fifteen feet apart, each decorated with banners. Judd's says "DOGS RULE!" and Jagger's says "BURGERS ARE BETTER!"

---

*(LIGHTS UP. JUDD stands at his grill, meticulously arranging hotdogs. JAGGER is at his grill, pressing down on burgers with aggressive satisfaction. BETHANY sits at a picnic table between them, phone ready.)*

**JUDD:** *(calling across)* I hope you brought your appetite for defeat, Jagger! These all-beef franks are going to smoke your sad little meat patties!

**JAGGER:** In your dreams, Judd! I've been perfecting my burger blend for months. Eighty percent chuck, twenty percent short rib. It's *art*.

**JUDD:** Art? You're just smashing ground beef! I've got seventeen different toppings bar stations! SEVENTEEN!

**BETHANY:** *(typing)* "Tension...sizzles...hotter...than...the grills—" Oh, that's good.

*(MAYA enters carrying a bowl of potato salad, trying to look invisible. CONNOR enters from the opposite side with a cooler.)*

**MAYA:** Dad, where do you want the—

**JUDD:** *(not looking)* Just put it anywhere, sweetie! Can't you see I'm in the zone?

*(MAYA sets down the bowl. CONNOR walks past her, and their eyes meet. He freezes, nearly dropping the cooler.)*

**CONNOR:** Hi.

**MAYA:** Hi.

**JAGGER:** *(shouting)* Connor! Stop lollygagging! I need the special sauce!

**CONNOR:** *(still staring at Maya)* Um...which cooler?

**JAGGER:** The RED one! The one in your hands!

**CONNOR:** Right. Yes. Red. *(He doesn't move.)*

**MAYA:** *(smiling)* I think he means you should bring it over there.

**CONNOR:** Oh! Yeah. I'm Connor.

**MAYA:** Maya.

**JUDD:** *(suddenly noticing)* Maya! Get away from that burger boy!

**JAGGER:** Burger *man*, thank you very much! And Connor, stop fraternizing with the enemy!

*(CONNOR and MAYA exchange embarrassed looks but don't move away from each other.)*

**CONNOR:** Your dad seems...intense.

**MAYA:** Yours too. They've been like this forever, apparently.

**CONNOR:** I heard they once got into a fistfight over who would take Lisa Vanderpool to prom.

**MAYA:** Who's Lisa Vanderpool?

**CONNOR:** No idea. She probably moved away to escape them.

*(They laugh. JUDD flips a hotdog too aggressively; it flies through the air.)*

**JUDD:** I meant to do that! That's a...test dog!

**JAGGER:** Sure it was! *(to Bethany)* Are you getting this? Mark down points for form!

**BETHANY:** This isn't judged on form—

**JAGGER:** It should be!

*(The rogue hotdog lands near MAYA's feet. CONNOR bends down to pick it up at the same time she does. Their hands touch. Awkward teenage electricity.)*

**MAYA:** Sorry—

**CONNOR:** No, I'm—

**BOTH:** *(together)* Sorry.

*(They laugh again.)*

**JUDD:** *(waving tongs)* Maya! I need you to start assembling the Chicago-style setup! Poppyseed buns, sport peppers, celery salt!

**MAYA:** Can I just have five—

**JUDD:** This is WAR, sweetheart! No time for breaks!

**JAGGER:** Connor! Where's my spatula?! The one with the rubber grip!

**CONNOR:** *(to Maya, quickly)* Do you like this? The whole competitive barbecue thing?

**MAYA:** Honestly? I'm a vegetarian.

**CONNOR:** *(gasps)* Me too!

*(They stare at each other with dawning realization and delight.)*

**JUDD & JAGGER:** *(simultaneously)* WHAT?!

*(Both dads spin around, shocked.)*

**JAGGER:** Since when are you a vegetarian?

**CONNOR:** Since...six months ago?

**JUDD:** You never told me this, Maya!

**MAYA:** I've told you approximately forty-five times. You were always too busy researching condiment pairings.

**BETHANY:** *(intrigued)* Ooh, this is a great angle for my blog.

**JUDD:** *(to Jagger)* This is YOUR fault! Your burger propaganda got into her head!

**JAGGER:** MY fault?! Your hotdog obsession clearly drove Connor to rebellion!

**CONNOR:** Actually, we just... care about the environment and animal welfare?

**MAYA:** Yeah. It's not about you two.

*(Beat. The dads look at each other, then back at their kids.)*

**JUDD:** Not about us?

**JAGGER:** But...we're having a COOK-OFF!

**MAYA:** *(to Connor)* Do you want to go get some of that falafel from the food truck across the park?

**CONNOR:** *(grinning)* I would love that.

*(They start walking off together.)*

**JUDD:** Wait! We need our assistants!

**JAGGER:** Who's going to taste-test?!

**MAYA:** *(over her shoulder)* Ask each other!

*(MAYA and CONNOR exit, laughing. The dads stare after them, then at each other.)*

**BETHANY:** Well, this is awkward.

**JAGGER:** Did my son just...run off with YOUR daughter?

**JUDD:** I think he did.

**JAGGER:** Huh.

*(Long pause.)*

**JUDD:** *(slowly)* Want to try one of my dogs?

**JAGGER:** *(considering)* Only if you try one of my burgers.

**BETHANY:** And the enemies become allies. I love it. *(typing)* "In...the...end...love...conquers...all..."

*(JUDD and JAGGER cautiously approach each other's grills as LIGHTS FADE.)*

**THE END**

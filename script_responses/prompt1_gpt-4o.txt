**Title: The Box in the Attic**

**Setting:** A dimly lit attic, cluttered with old furniture, dusty trunks, and stacks of forgotten memories. A single overhead bulb casts a flickering light, revealing clouds of dust every time something is moved. Center stage sits an ornate wooden box, its intricate carvings weathered by time.

**ANNA**  
*(Pushing aside a stack of dusty photo albums)*  
Leo, we’re not making any progress. This is taking forever.

**LEO**  
*(Holding up an old hat and placing it on his head, smiling)*  
Relax, Anna. It’s not a race. Besides, this place is a treasure trove. Who knows what secrets Grandma left us?

**ANNA**  
*(Sighs, brushing cobwebs off her shirt)*  
Secrets, right. I’m just hoping we can organize this chaos before midnight.

**LEO**  
Hey, look what I found! *(He gestures towards the ornate box positioned on the floor between them)* This looks promising.

**ANNA**  
*(Kneeling beside Leo, inspecting the box)*  
It’s beautiful. But it’s locked. Typical.

**LEO**  
Which makes it even more intriguing! There's probably something magical inside.

**ANNA**  
*(Rolling her eyes)*  
Or just another stack of old letters or a bunch of faded trinkets we’ll end up donating.

**LEO**  
You always did lack imagination, Anna. I say we break it open and see what’s inside.

**ANNA**  
*(Alarmed)*  
Break it? Leo, it’s probably an antique! We should find the key. It’s likely here somewhere.

**LEO**  
*(Playfully shakes the box and listens for a rattle)*  
Come on, don’t you want to know right now? Imagine we open it and find nothing, just dust! Wouldn’t that be a fun letdown?

**ANNA**  
*(Sarcastically)*  
Thrilling. Look, if it meant enough to her to keep it locked, we should try to respect that.

**LEO**  
Alright, Miss Pragmatic. But what if we never find the key? How about I just use this old crowbar over—?

**ANNA**  
*(Interrupting)*  
No crowbars! We owe it to her to at least try looking, don’t we? Who knows what stories this box holds?

**LEO**  
*(Grinning)*  
Ah, there’s the Anna I know, chasing after stories like they’re building blueprints.

**ANNA**  
*(Standing, brushing off her pants)*  
It’s not your optimism; Grandpa always said it was the architect in me—unraveling puzzles, not smashing them apart.

**LEO**  
Well, you go be Nancy Drew, and I’ll keep on exploring this wonderland. Just remember: if we’re still searching at three in the morning, I’m cracking it open, key or not.

**ANNA**  
Deal. But I’m convinced we’ll find it before then. Let’s see... Grandma had a knack for hiding things in the most unexpected places.

**LEO**  
*(Jokingly)*  
Like beneath those crocheted doilies?

**ANNA**  
*(Laughs lightly)*  
Perhaps. But it’s a start. Now, where should we...

**LEO**  
*(Interrupting, bending down to search casually through a pile of old books)*  
I’ll take this corner. You take that one. But if we find a map with ‘X’ marking the spot, I call dibs.

**ANNA**  
*(Smiling, they each move to different sides of the attic, determined)*  
Fine by me. Just don’t get lost in your daydreams.

**[The overhead light flickers once more as they begin their search, each knowing that whatever they uncover may change how they remember their grandmother — and each other.]**

**CURTAIN.**

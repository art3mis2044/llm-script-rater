**Title: The Key to Memory**

**Setting: A cluttered attic, filled with dusty boxes and covered furniture. Sunlight filters through a small window, casting a glow on floating dust particles. ANNA and LEO are kneeling beside an old trunk, surrounded by various knick-knacks.**

---

**ANNA**  
*(holding up a brittle, yellowed photograph)*  
Look at this, Leo. Grandma and Grandpa, in front of their first home. She looks so happy.

**LEO**  
*(peering over her shoulder)*  
And Grandpa... what a snazzy bow tie! Wish I could pull that off.

**ANNA**  
Focus, Leo. We have to get through all this. Mom will be here soon to pick up whatever we sort.

**LEO**  
*(picking up a dusty snow globe)*  
We’re not in a race, you know. Besides, this place is a treasure trove of memories!  

*(sets the snow globe down and spots an ornate wooden box)*  

Woah, check this out!

**ANNA**  
*(examining the box)*  
Oh wow. This is intricate... there’s even a little lock. 

**LEO**  
Gone all Nancy Drew, Anna? Think there’s a hidden fortune inside?

**ANNA**  
Probably just some old letters or random knick-knacks. But it could be important. We should find the key.

**LEO**  
Or we could open it the easy way. *(mimics prying open the box)*

**ANNA**  
Absolutely not. A little patience could preserve whatever’s inside. Destruction... not so much.

**LEO**  
I’m just saying, if it’s this hard to open, maybe it’s meant to be. Like a test of spontaneity!

**ANNA**  
*(dryly)*  
Spontaneity and I haven’t exactly been on speaking terms lately.

**LEO**  
Exactly why it’s time the two of you make up! *("suggestively)* Who knows, Anna, maybe there’s a key right here. *(gestures theatrically around the attic)* Waiting for us to find it, like a movie moment!

**ANNA**  
There’s just stuff everywhere. The key could be anywhere.

**LEO**  
(gesturing to a pile of hats)  
Maybe it’s in one of these hats? Grandma loved those.

**ANNA**  
*(teasing)*  
Right. It must be in the felt fedora that doubles as a secret hideaway.

**LEO**  
*(grinning)*  
Now you get it!

*(Anna rolls her eyes but starts checking under the hats)*

**LEO**  
*(tries a couple of hats himself, placing one on his head flamboyantly)*  
How do I look?

**ANNA**  
*(smirking)*  
Like a man possessed by the spirit of Broadway.

**LEO**  
*(takes a bow)*  
Why, thank you! Perhaps beneath my dramatic flair lies the heart of a romantic.

**ANNA**  
*(glancing around)*  
More like a taller version of Grandma’s favorite house cat. What about under the dresser?

**LEO**  
*(rubbing his chin thoughtfully)*  
You know, Grandpa always said secrets are what keep life exciting. I bet this box is one of those secrets!

**ANNA**  
If only we could unlock it the way Grandma unlocked recipes—by heart. She never wrote anything down.

**LEO**  
And yet, her cookies were legendary.

**ANNA**  
*(pauses, looks wistfully at the box)*  
I guess this box is part of that legacy, something she kept close for a reason.

**LEO**  
Which is why we should crack it open and see!

**ANNA**  
Fine. But let’s agree to be careful, okay?

**LEO**  
*(winks)*  
Careful is my middle name.

*(Leo gently pries at the lock, while Anna watches with a mix of trepidation and curiosity.)*

**ANNA**  
*(after a moment)*  
Here goes nothing.  

*(The lock clicks open. They pause, exchanging a glance, then slowly lift the lid.)*

**LEO**  
*(peering in, softly)*  
Well, would you look at that...

**ANNA**  
*(smiling through bittersweet tears)*  
Her love letters to Grandpa.

**LEO**  
And this photo... it’s the day they met, isn’t it?

**ANNA**  
*(nods, touching the photo delicately)*  
Grandma’s real treasure.

*(They sit in silence for a beat, reflecting.)*

**LEO**  
*(gently closing the box)*  
Guess you were right about being careful. Sometimes, it’s about opening things with the right touch.

**ANNA**  
*(puts an arm around him)*  
And sometimes, it’s about taking a leap. Thanks, Leo.

**LEO**  
Anytime, sis. Anytime.

*(They continue sorting through the attic, this time with a little less hurry and a little more wonder.)*

**Curtain falls.**

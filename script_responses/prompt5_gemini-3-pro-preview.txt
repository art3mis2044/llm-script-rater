**Title:** Turbulence and Tears
**Characters:**

*   **MIKE (17):** Exhausted, terrified, just wants to go home.
*   **BRENDA:** The Flight Attendant. Currently weeping.
*   **BARBARA:** The Crazy Lady. Convinced the plane is made of paper.
*   **ZIGGY:** The Guitarist. Too chill for his own good.
*   **THE ECCENTRIC CHORUS:**
    *   *Chad (Finance Bro), Madame Cleo (Psychic), Conspiracy Carl, Yoga Janet, Hazmat Harry, The Knitter, Timmy (The Seat Kicker), Baby Tyler (The Screamer), Opera Olga, Captain Sleepy (Pilot on break).*

**Setting:** *The interior of Flight 666 from California to Florida. It is cramped. It is loud. The "Fasten Seatbelt" sign is flickering ominously.*

***

**(The scene opens mid-flight. The plane shakes violently. MIKE is squeezed into middle seat 24B. To his left is BARBARA, gripping his arm with claw-like fingernails. To his right is ZIGGY, tuning a small travel acoustic guitar.)**

**(Sound FX: A baby screaming at 100 decibels.)**

**BRENDA**
*(Over Intercom, voice cracking)*
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We are currently experiencing some... *turbulence*. Just like my relationship experienced turbulence three days ago when I found Kevin’s texts. If you look to your left, you’ll see clouds. If you look at Kevin’s phone, you’ll see he’s been messaging a Pilates instructor named Tiffany.

**BARBARA**
*(Shaking Mike)*
Did you feel that? The engine stopped! I heard it! It coughed!

**MIKE**
It didn't cough, ma'am. That was the guy in 25C.

**(Behind them, HAZMAT HARRY stands up in a full yellow bio-hazard suit and sprays a cloud of Lysol over Mike’s head.)**

**HAZMAT HARRY**
Contaminants! We’re breathing recycled death!

**ZIGGY**
*(Strums a chill G-chord)*
Hey, hazmat-dude. You’re blocking my vibes. And the airflow.

**BRENDA**
*(Over Intercom, sobbing)*
We will be coming through the cabin shortly with beverages. Unlike Kevin, I still serve people. I don’t just *take*, Kevin! I don’t just take the best years of someone's life and the espresso machine!

**(The plane drops suddenly. Everyone screams except Ziggy, who plays a riff.)**

**BARBARA**
WE’RE GOING DOWN! GRAVITY IS A LIE BUT IT’S STILL GOING TO KILL US!

**MIKE**
Please, lady, my arm. You’re drawing blood.

**CHAD**
*(Standing up, yelling into a Bluetooth headset)*
Sell! Sell the crypto! I don’t care if we’re dropping, sell the Bitcoin! Buy gold! No, buy water!

**CONSPIRACY CARL**
*(Leaning over the seat in front of Mike)*
You know the turbulence is fake, right kid? It’s the magnetic fields from the subterranean lizard people. They want our luggage.

**MIKE**
I just want a ginger ale. Please. I’m seventeen. I have a permit. I shouldn't die like this.

**(Suddenly, YOGA JANET throws her legs into the air, attempting a handstand in the aisle next to Mike.)**

**YOGA JANET**
Align your chakras! The fear is stored in the hips!

**TIMMY**
*(Kicking the back of Mike’s seat rhythmically)*
Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick.

**MADAME CLEO**
*(Grabbing Mike’s free hand from across the aisle)*
I see darkness! I see a water landing! Or maybe just a spilled soda. The spirits are unclear!

**OPERA OLGA**
*(Singing high C)*
*MEEEEEEEMOOOOORIIIIIIEEEES!*

**THE KNITTER**
*(Aggressively knitting a scarf that is currently draped over Mike’s face)*
Hold still, dear. I dropped a stitch.

**MIKE**
*(Pulls the scarf off)*
Is anyone flying this plane?!

**CAPTAIN SLEEPY**
*(Walks out of the cockpit in pajamas, holding a teddy bear)*
Bathroom break. Don't worry, the autopilot is... mostly reliable.

**BRENDA**
*(Walking down the aisle, mascara running, holding a pot of coffee)*
Does anyone want coffee? It’s black. Like my heart. Like the void Kevin left.

**ZIGGY**
Yo, Brenda. Play us a song?

**BRENDA**
*(Screaming)*
HE TOOK THE DOG, ZIGGY! HE TOOK BUSTER!

**(Baby Tyler screeches louder. The plane shakes violently again. Barbara screams and hugs Mike, burying her face in his neck.)**

**BARBARA**
TELL MY MOTHER I HATED HER LASAGNA!

**MIKE**
*(Looking at the ceiling, deadpan)*
If we crash, at least I won’t have to hear the breakup story again.

**ZIGGY**
*(Strumming)*
It’s all about the journey, man.

**MIKE**
I hate Florida.

**(The lights flicker out. Total darkness.)**

**BRENDA (V.O.)**
Please ensure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright and locked positions. Just like Tiffany’s heart is locked to Satan!

**ALL ELEVEN ECCENTRICS**
*(In unison)*
SCREAM!

**(Blackout.)**

**(End of Scene)**

**THE GREAT GRILL-OFF**

*A public park. Two elaborate grilling stations are set up on opposite sides of the stage. JUDD (45, wearing a "HOT DOG CHAMPION" apron) mans the left station. JAGGER (45, sporting a "BURGER BOSS" cap) commands the right. Between them, picnic tables are laden with condiments. MAYA (16, Judd's daughter) and TYLER (16, Jagger's son) stand awkwardly near the center.*

**JUDD:** (*shouting across*) Those patties look drier than the Sahara, Jagger!

**JAGGER:** At least I'm not serving mystery meat in intestine casings!

**MAYA:** (*to Tyler, rolling her eyes*) How long have they been at this?

**TYLER:** According to my dad? Since 1993. According to my mom? Since the dawn of time.

*They share a laugh. JUDD notices and waves his tongs threateningly.*

**JUDD:** Maya! Get over here and help your old man show these amateurs how it's done!

**MAYA:** Dad, I'm just—

**JAGGER:** Tyler! Stop fraternizing with the enemy!

**TYLER:** (*muttering*) Enemy? It's processed meat, not the Cold War.

*MAYA and TYLER exchange amused glances. As they move to help their fathers, they "accidentally" bump into each other.*

**MAYA & TYLER:** (*simultaneously*) Sorry! (*then, simultaneously again*) Jinx!

*They laugh. Their fathers glare.*

**JUDD:** (*flipping hot dogs with excessive flair*) You see this technique? Passed down through three generations of Johnsons!

*A hot dog flies off the grill and lands in JAGGER's hamburger station.*

**JAGGER:** SABOTAGE! (*accidentally squirts ketchup, hitting JUDD's shirt*) 

**JUDD:** Oh, it's ON! (*sprays mustard back*)

*MAYA and TYLER duck under a picnic table together to avoid the condiment crossfire.*

**TYLER:** (*while under the table*) You know, I'm actually a vegetarian.

**MAYA:** (*giggling*) Me too! I haven't told my dad yet. It might literally kill him.

**TYLER:** Same. I think my dad would disown me. (*pause*) Hey, want to grab pizza after this disaster?

**MAYA:** (*smiling*) I'd love that.

*They emerge from under the table. Their fathers are now covered in condiments, breathing heavily.*

**JUDD:** (*panting*) Best... two out of three?

**JAGGER:** (*wheezing*) You're going down, Judd!

*MAYA grabs a hot dog. TYLER grabs a hamburger. They walk to the center.*

**MAYA:** Dad, Jagger's burger is actually pretty good.

**TYLER:** Judd, this hot dog is incredible.

**JUDD & JAGGER:** (*simultaneously*) WHAT?!

**MAYA:** (*taking Tyler's hand*) And we're going to get pizza. Together.

**TYLER:** See you at home!

*They exit. JUDD and JAGGER stand frozen, mouths agape, still dripping condiments.*

**JUDD:** Did your son just—

**JAGGER:** Did your daughter just—

**BOTH:** (*looking at each other, then at the audience*) PIZZA?!

*Lights fade as they rush offstage after their kids, slipping on spilled condiments.*

**INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY**

*(The scene opens with a cacophony—baby cries, a loud cellphone conversation, laughter, and the general din of a packed flight. The plane *SHUDDERS* with turbulence. Mike sits between CL, who grips her armrest tightly, and LBG, strumming softly on an acoustic guitar.)*

**MIKE**: (To himself) Just need to make it back to Florida in one piece. No grandmas. No turbulence. No—

**CL**: (Interrupting, frantically) Oh god! What was that?! Did you hear that noise? We’re going down, aren’t we?

**MIKE**: (Trying to reassure) No, no, it’s just turbulence. They say it’s normal.

**LBG**: (Chilled out) Yeah, man. Just like life's ups and downs. Ride the wave, you know?

**CL**: (Panicky) I didn’t sign up to become a surfer! This is terrifying!

*(Suddenly, the intercom *CRACKLES* to life.)*

**FA (V.O.)**: (Voice trembling, with a forced attempt at professionalism) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your flight attendant speaking. I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt your flight but... (voice breaking) Todd, if you're listening, why did you leave me? What did I do wrong? I thought we were happy!

*(Passengers exchange glances, eyes wide with disbelief.)*

**BUSINESSMAN**: (Loudly) Can you believe this? Some of us are trying to work here!

**CHEF**: (Offering cookies) Cookie, dear? Helps calm the nerves.

**NERVOUS MAN**: (Almost hyperventilating) We’re all gonna die. I knew I should’ve stayed home!

**VLOGGER 1**: (To camera) Guys, you won’t believe this! Our flight is, like, so dramatic!

**VLOGGER 2**: (Excitedly) Is this live? This has to be live!

**MAGICIAN**: (Eager) Here, pick a card, any card.

*(The plane *LURCHES*, causing varied passenger reactions—gasps, laughter, screaming. FA continues through intercom, audibly sobbing.)*

**FA (V.O.)**: And you know what, Todd? I don't care if you're listening or not. We are better off without you, right folks? (Pauses, regains some composure) So, um, enjoy the complimentary peanuts.

**MIKE**: (Wide-eyed, whispering to LBG) This is insane. I just wanted a calm flight home.

**LBG**: (Strumming unconcernedly) Just go with the flow, man. Not much else to do, right?

**SPORTS FAN**: (Suddenly stands) Go team! Anything’s better after a good game, am I right?

**KNITTER**: (Without looking up) Honey, life's just one big knitting project. Sometimes you gotta drop a stitch to make it right.

**MAGICIAN**: (Delighted, showing a card) Is this your card?

**OPTIMISTIC TOURIST**: (Gleefully) Oh, look at the view! Isn’t this just wonderful? 

*(The plane rattles again; FA resumes with a clearer voice.)*

**FA (V.O.)**: (Attempting a calm tone) Thank you for flying with us. We're... well, we're almost there. Literally and metaphorically.

**MIKE**: (Defeated, turning to CL) Maybe I should’ve taken the bus.

**CL**: (Calmer now, squeezing Mike’s hand) Thanks for being my landing gear, kid.

**LBG**: (Serenely) We’ll be on the ground soon. Until then, let's jam through it.

*(The baby resumes crying as the lights begin dimming for descent. The cabin falls into a quieter hum, with optimism somehow prevailing amid the chaotic flight.)*

**MIKE**: (Smiling slightly, to himself) Just another day in paradise. Almost home.

*(Scene closes with the gentle hum of the plane descending and ambient, hopeful strumming from LBG.)*

**BLACKOUT.**

# THE SHELTER
*A one-act scene*

**CHARACTERS:**
- MARINA, 30s, a marine biologist
- DEREK, 40s, a construction worker
- YUKI, 20s, a medical student
- THOMAS, 50s, Marina's estranged father

**SETTING:** A subway platform, present day. The lights flicker intermittently. A distant rumbling grows louder throughout the scene.

---

*(AT RISE: MARINA stands alone on the platform, checking her phone. DEREK enters, hard hat in hand, covered in dust. YUKI rushes in, medical textbooks clutched to her chest.)*

**DEREK:** *(to no one in particular)* No signal. Anyone else got bars?

**YUKI:** Nothing. The whole network's down.

*(The rumbling intensifies. A loudspeaker crackles to life.)*

**VOICE:** (O.S.) Attention. This is not a drill. All citizens must take immediate shelter underground. Seismic activity has reached critical levels. Repeat: seek underground shelter immediately.

*(THOMAS enters, breathing heavily, clutching a manila envelope.)*

**THOMAS:** Is this... is this the Orange Line?

**MARINA:** *(freezing, recognizing him)* Dad?

*(An awkward beat. The ground shakes violently. They all stumble.)*

**DEREK:** Jesus! We need to get to the tunnels—deeper in!

**YUKI:** My hospital—I have to get to Sacred Heart. There'll be casualties, I should—

**DEREK:** You won't make it three blocks! Look!

*(He points offstage. A red glow flickers. Dust begins falling from the ceiling.)*

**MARINA:** *(still staring at THOMAS)* What are you doing here?

**THOMAS:** I... I was looking for you. Your office said you'd be at the harbor station. I've been trying to find—

**MARINA:** For six years? You've been trying for six years?

**DEREK:** Hey! Family reunion later! We need to move!

**YUKI:** He's right. The platform could collapse.

*(Another violent shake. A support beam groans overhead.)*

**THOMAS:** *(desperately, to MARINA)* I have your mother's research. *(holds up envelope)* About the fault lines, the warnings no one listened to. She was right. About all of it.

**MARINA:** *(bitter laugh)* She was right. And now she's dead. And you're here with her papers like some kind of—

*(A massive CRACK. Part of the ceiling falls at stage right.)*

**DEREK:** The north tunnel! NOW!

*(DEREK grabs YUKI's arm. They start running stage left.)*

**YUKI:** *(looking back)* Come ON!

**THOMAS:** Marina, please. Let me explain—

**MARINA:** *(voice breaking)* You left us when she was sick. When I needed—

*(The lights go completely dark except for emergency lights. Another massive rumble. A wall of debris falls between center and stage left—separating MARINA and THOMAS from DEREK and YUKI.)*

**DEREK:** (O.S., from beyond the debris) HELLO?! ARE YOU OKAY?!

**MARINA:** *(coughing through dust)* We're cut off!

**YUKI:** (O.S.) There's another tunnel! East side! You have to go east!

**THOMAS:** *(calling out)* We'll find another way!

**DEREK:** (O.S.) Don't wait! Keep moving!

*(Silence. Then the sound of footsteps running away in the distance. MARINA and THOMAS are alone. The rumbling continues, softer but persistent. They look at each other across the devastated platform.)*

**MARINA:** *(quietly)* There is no east tunnel.

**THOMAS:** What?

**MARINA:** They closed it. Three months ago. Structural damage.

*(Beat. This information sinks in.)*

**THOMAS:** Then we... *(gestures to the debris blocking the north tunnel)*

**MARINA:** We wait. Or we go up.

**THOMAS:** The voice said underground—

**MARINA:** I know what it said.

*(They stand in the flickering emergency lights. THOMAS holds out the envelope again.)*

**THOMAS:** She wrote you letters. Inside. One for every month I was gone.

*(MARINA doesn't take it. The ground trembles again, gentler this time, but more ominous—like a held breath.)*

**MARINA:** *(finally looking at him)* Are we going to die here?

**THOMAS:** I don't know.

*(Beat.)*

**MARINA:** I don't forgive you.

**THOMAS:** I know.

*(MARINA slowly reaches out and takes the envelope. Their hands touch briefly. The rumbling grows louder again, rising. They both look up at the ceiling. Then at each other.)*

**THOMAS:** Marina, I—

*(BLACKOUT. In the darkness, the sound of the rumble crescendos then abruptly CUTS to complete silence.)*

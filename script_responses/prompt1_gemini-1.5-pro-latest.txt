## Attic Symphony

**(The attic is crammed with dusty furniture, boxes overflowing with forgotten memories, and cobwebs thick enough to snare butterflies. ANNA, in practical jeans and a paint-splattered t-shirt, sifts meticulously through a trunk. LEO, in brightly coloured patchwork trousers and a too-large, knitted sweater, balances precariously on a three-legged stool, peering into a cobweb-filled corner.)**

**ANNA:** (Sighing)  Another box of doilies. Grandma really loved doilies.

**LEO:** (Grinning, holding up a feathered boa)  Aha! Look what I found!  Perfect for our next fancy dress party.

**ANNA:** (Dryly)  Leo, we haven’t had a "fancy dress party" since we were ten and you insisted on going as a sentient cactus.

**LEO:** (Dramatically draping the boa around his neck)  Never say never!  Besides, this boa speaks to me. It whispers of forgotten glamour and… (He sneezes explosively, sending a cloud of dust swirling.) …and dust mites.

**ANNA:** Please. Just try to be helpful. We need to finish sorting through this lot before the estate agent comes tomorrow.

**(Anna pulls a heavy, ornately carved wooden box from the bottom of the trunk. It’s secured with a brass lock.)**

**ANNA:** Now this is interesting.

**LEO:** (Abandoning the boa, he hops off the stool and crouches beside her.) Ooh, treasure!  Pirate booty?  Grandma's secret stash of Werther's Originals?

**ANNA:**  Let’s be realistic. Probably more doilies.  But the box is beautiful.  Let’s see if we can find the key.

**(Anna starts rummaging through the trunk again.)**

**LEO:** (Picking up a rusty crowbar leaning against a stack of old newspapers)  Or… we could just do this.

**ANNA:** Leo!  Put that down!  You'll ruin it!

**LEO:** (Grinning)  Efficiency, dear sister.  A little "persuasion" and – bam! – instant gratification.  Besides, anticipation is the thief of joy.

**ANNA:** And brute force is the thief of antique boxes.  Grandma obviously meant for this to be opened with the key.  It’s probably around here somewhere.

**(She continues searching, increasingly frantic.  Leo examines the box, running his fingers over the intricate carvings.)**

**LEO:** This wood… it feels… ancient. Like it holds stories within stories.  I bet this box has seen things.  Heard things.

**ANNA:** (Muttering)  Probably heard a lot of complaining about dust and doilies.

**LEO:**  (Shaking his head) You lack a sense of wonder, Anna.  This box is a mystery waiting to be unveiled!  It's practically vibrating with secrets!

**ANNA:** It’s vibrating with the potential to be splintered into a million pieces if you don’t put down that crowbar.

**LEO:** (Sighing dramatically)  Fine, fine.  But if we don’t find the key in five minutes, I’m claiming finder’s keepers and invoking the right of the impatient.

**ANNA:**  (Ignoring him, she pulls out a small, tarnished key hidden in a velvet pouch.)  Aha!

**(She tries the key in the lock. It sticks.  She jiggles it, and with a satisfying click, the lock opens.)**

**LEO:** (Leaning in excitedly)  See? Patience is a virtue. What's inside? Jewels?  Gold doubloons?  The deed to a tropical island?

**(Anna slowly lifts the lid, revealing… a neatly folded pile of hand-knitted baby clothes, in various shades of pastel pink and blue.)**

**ANNA:** (Blinking)  Baby clothes?

**LEO:** (After a beat of stunned silence, he bursts out laughing.) Grandma's secret stash of… baby booties?  Oh, the irony!

**ANNA:** (A small smile playing on her lips)  Well, I suppose they are rather… cute.

**LEO:** (Picking up a tiny, knitted bonnet)  Imagine little baby me in this.  Absolutely adorable.

**(He places the bonnet on his head, striking a pose.  Anna shakes her head, but her smile widens.  The attic, filled with the dust of memories, suddenly feels a little less cluttered, a little less overwhelming, and a little bit more… magical.)**

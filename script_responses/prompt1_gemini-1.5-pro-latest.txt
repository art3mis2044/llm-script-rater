## Scene: Attic - Grandma's Legacy

**Setting:** A cramped, dusty attic. Boxes overflow with old clothes, photographs, and forgotten treasures. Sunlight streams through a grimy skylight, illuminating floating dust motes.

**(ANNA, dressed in practical jeans and a t-shirt, is meticulously sorting through a box of old sheet music. LEO, sporting paint-splattered overalls and a brightly coloured bandana, is perched precariously on a stack of vintage suitcases, holding a locked wooden box.)**

**LEO:** (Shakes the box dramatically)  Listen!  There's something in here!  Destiny calls!  Adventure awaits!

**ANNA:** (Without looking up) Probably mothballs and disappointment. Put it down, Leo. You’ll break something.

**LEO:** But Anna, look!  It's beautiful.  Intricate carvings, probably hand-made. This box has *secrets*.

**ANNA:**  Everything in this attic has secrets. Mostly secrets of mild hoarding and questionable fashion choices.

**LEO:**  But this is different!  This is… (Whispers) …treasure.

He holds the box up to the light, turning it slowly.

**ANNA:** (Sighs)  If it's treasure, it’ll still be there when we find the key.  Grandma kept *everything* organized. There’s bound to be a key somewhere.

**LEO:**  “Organized chaos” you mean. Look at this place!  We’ll be sifting through doilies and dentures for the next decade!  Life’s too short for key-searching, Anna.  We need action!

**ANNA:**  We need to be methodical. Grandma would have wanted…

**LEO:** Grandma would have wanted us to have fun! To embrace the unknown! To crack this bad boy open and discover its hidden wonders!

He mimes breaking the box open with his elbow.

**ANNA:**  Don't you dare!  You’ll damage it!  It could be antique!

**LEO:**  Exactly!  Antiques are cool!  Imagine, ancient jewels, a pirate's map, a shrunken head –

**ANNA:**  A recipe for fruitcake, more likely.

Leo pulls a small crowbar from his overalls pocket.

**ANNA:**  Where did you even get that?

**LEO:**  A magician never reveals his secrets.  Now, stand back!  Witness the unveiling!

**ANNA:**  Leo, stop! This is ridiculous.  Put the crowbar down.

She lunges for the crowbar, but Leo dodges, holding the box out of reach.

**LEO:**  Too late! The thrill of the chase has consumed me!  The siren song of the unknown whispers my name!

**ANNA:** (Exasperated)  You're being melodramatic.  It’s just a box, Leo.

**LEO:** (Holding the box aloft)  Nay! It is a vessel of forgotten dreams! A Pandora's Box of potential! A…

He loses his balance, teetering precariously on the suitcases.

**ANNA:** Leo! Careful!

**LEO:** (Flailing)  Whoa!  I’m… falling!

He tumbles off the suitcases, landing in a heap amongst a pile of old cushions.  The box flies from his hands and lands with a soft thud on the floor.  It remains closed.

**ANNA:** (Rushing to his side)  Are you okay?

**LEO:** (Groaning)  Yeah, just winded.  Those cushions are surprisingly resilient.

He sits up, dusting himself off.

**ANNA:**  See?  What did I tell you?  You could have hurt yourself.

Leo looks towards the box.

**LEO:**  And the box…  It survived.  Unopened. Untouched.  Unviolated.

**ANNA:**  (Smirking)  Maybe destiny wants us to find the key after all.

She bends down and picks up a small, tarnished key lying amongst the cushions, almost hidden in the fabric.

**LEO:** (Staring at the key)  Well, I’ll be…

**ANNA:**  What do you know?  Grandma was organized after all.

She approaches the box, key in hand.

**LEO:** (Suddenly energized)  Wait! Let me do it!

He snatches the key from Anna and inserts it into the lock.  He turns the key, and the box clicks open.  They both lean in, anticipation etched on their faces.

**(The scene ends before the contents of the box are revealed.)**

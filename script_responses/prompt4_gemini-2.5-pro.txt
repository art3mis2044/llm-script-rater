## Grill and Grace

**By A Helpful Assistant**

**Characters:**

*   **JUDD** (40s): A man whose entire self-worth is tied to the structural integrity and "snap" of a well-cooked hotdog. Wears a "Top Dog" apron.
*   **JAGGER** (40s): A man who believes the hamburger is the pinnacle of human achievement. Wears a "Patty Daddy" apron.
*   **CHLOE** (16): Judd's daughter. Sarcastic, observant, and deeply embarrassed by her father's obsession.
*   **LEO** (16): Jagger's son. Awkward, kind, and wishes his father would just use a microwave sometimes.

**Setting:**

A sunny afternoon in a public park. Two top-of-the-line barbecue grills are set up back-to-back, like dueling pistols at dawn. Each has its own condiment station, picnic table, and branding. On one side, hotdog paraphernalia. On the other, a shrine to the hamburger.

**(The scene opens with a plume of smoke rising from each grill. JUDD and JAGGER are at their respective stations, engaged in a cold war of culinary preparation.)**

**JAGGER**
(Without looking up from forming a perfect patty)
The key is the 80/20 blend. Any more fat, you get a grease fire. Any less, you might as well be eating a hockey puck. It’s science.

**JUDD**
(Arranging a string of artisanal sausages on his grill)
Science? The hotdog is art, Jagger. It’s a perfect cylinder of possibility. A self-contained vessel of flavor. You can’t overcook it, you can’t undercook it. It’s democratic. It’s… pure.

**JAGGER**
It’s processed mystery meat in a tube. My burger is a symphony of seared perfection, a testament to the majesty of the cow.

**(CHLOE sits at Judd’s picnic table, texting on her phone, looking mortified. LEO stands nervously by Jagger’s table, arranging lettuce.)**

**CHLOE**
(To herself)
It’s a tube of meat, dad. Let’s not get poetic.

**JUDD**
Did you hear that, Chloe? He’s maligning the dog! The food of kings! Hand me the secret spice blend.

**(Chloe sighs, picks up a shaker labeled "SECRET SPICE" in her dad’s handwriting, and hands it over without enthusiasm. Her eyes meet LEO’s across the grassy no-man's-land. He gives a small, apologetic shrug. She offers a weak, sympathetic smile.)**

**JAGGER**
Leo, son! The cheese. We need to respect the cheese. A slice of American should melt, not surrender. It should drape the patty like a velvet blanket.

**LEO**
Right. A velvet blanket. Got it.

**(Leo fumbles with the plastic-wrapped cheese slices. He drops one on the ground. Jagger lets out a pained groan.)**

**JAGGER**
That’s a fallen soldier, son! We leave him behind.

**(Jagger flips a burger with a dramatic flourish, sending a cascade of sparks into the air. This action catches the attention of BUSTER, a golden retriever of immense appetite and zero morals, who has been lurking by a nearby bush.)**

**JUDD**
Show-off. It’s not about the flip, Jagger, it’s about the roll! A gentle, even rotation to ensure a consistent char. Watch and learn.

**(Judd uses his long tongs to begin the delicate process of rolling his prize-winning sausages. He turns his back for a split second to grab a bun.)**

**JUDD**
(CONT'D)
And now, the vessel…

**(In that split second, BUSTER makes his move. A blur of golden fur. He leaps, snags the entire string of sausages from the grill with surgical precision, and vanishes back into the bushes. It happens so fast it’s almost magical.)**

**JUDD**
(Turning back)
…for the glorious…

**(He stops. His tongs hover over an empty grill. He blinks.)**

**JUDD**
(CONT'D)
My dogs… My dogs are gone.

**JAGGER**
(Peeking around his grill with a smug grin)
What’s the matter, Judd? Did they get up and walk away?

**JUDD**
(Cradling the empty tongs like a fallen sword)
They were stolen. Snatched! It was you, wasn't it? Industrial sabotage!

**JAGGER**
Please. I wouldn’t soil my grill with your pathetic tubesteaks.

**(While the dads argue, Leo crosses the divide over to Chloe.)**

**LEO**
Uh, hey. I saw what happened. It was a dog. A really fast dog.

**CHLOE**
The Sausage Heist of 2023. I'll alert the media. My dad’s going to be insufferable now. More than usual.

**LEO**
My dad's already declared victory. He’s planning his parade speech. I'm really sorry.

**CHLOE**
It’s not your fault our dads have the emotional maturity of rival squirrels.

**(Leo laughs. It’s a nice, genuine sound.)**

**LEO**
Yeah. Look, I have an idea. It’s probably sacrilege, but…

**(He gestures for her to follow him. He quickly grabs one of Jagger’s perfectly cooked cheeseburgers. He whispers to Chloe.)**

**LEO**
(CONT'D)
And you have the buns, right? The hotdog buns?

**CHLOE**
(A slow, mischievous grin spreads across her face)
Oh, I think I see where this is going. This is an act of treason.

**LEO**
Or an act of peace.

**(A moment later, Judd and Jagger’s argument is interrupted by Chloe clearing her throat.)**

**CHLOE**
Gentlemen. We present a compromise.

**(Leo holds out a paper plate. On it sits a cheeseburger, but instead of being on a round bun, it has been cut in half and nestled snugly inside a long hotdog bun, topped with ketchup and mustard.)**

**JUDD**
(Staring in horror)
What… what is that abomination?

**JAGGER**
You put my masterpiece… in *that*? It’s unnatural!

**LEO**
We call it the… Burger-Dog.

**CHLOE**
Or the Ham-Dogger. We’re workshopping it.

**(Judd and Jagger look at the creation, then at each other. For the first time all day, they share the exact same expression: utter, unadulterated disgust. Leo and Chloe look at the monstrosity they’ve created, then at each other, and try to stifle their laughter.)**

**LEO**
(Quietly, to Chloe)
Maybe we just grab some chips and go sit by the lake?

**CHLOE**
(Smiling)
That’s the best idea I’ve heard all day.

**(As the dads continue to stare, united in their shared culinary horror, Leo and Chloe slip away, leaving the lone Ham-Dogger sitting between the two enemy camps, a strange symbol of a truce they didn't even know they needed.)**

**(FADE OUT.)**

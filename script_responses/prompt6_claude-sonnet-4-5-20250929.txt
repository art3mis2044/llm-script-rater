**CHARACTERS:**

**SETTING:** A camping ground at night. Two tents stage left and right. A makeshift campfire center stage (can be represented by red/orange lights or fake logs).

---

*(Lights up. All six teenagers are huddled around the dying campfire, wrapped in sleeping bags. MARCUS fidgets uncomfortably.)*

**TYLER:** (standing proudly) And THIS, my friends, is what freedom tastes like! No parents, no rules, just us living our best—

**MARCUS:** (squirming) Guys, I need to pee again.

**JADE:** Again?! Marcus, that's the fifth time in two hours!

**MARCUS:** (defensive) I told you I shouldn't have had three Gatorades before we left!

**BREE:** (holding up phone, checking herself) Ugh, there's STILL no signal. How am I supposed to post our #SeniorTripGoals if I can't even upload?

**MAYA:** (frantically checking notebook) Bree, we're supposed to be off the grid! That was literally bullet point number seven in the itinerary I made—

**LEO:** Maya, you made an itinerary for "sneaking out and being rebels"?

**MAYA:** Of course! Someone has to keep us organized! We're supposed to have s'mores at 9:47, ghost stories at 10:15—

*(A loud HOWL echoes offstage. Everyone freezes.)*

**MARCUS:** (panicked) WHAT WAS THAT?!

**TYLER:** (trying to sound brave) Probably just... the wind?

**JADE:** Wind doesn't howl in a minor key, Tyler.

**BREE:** (clutching TYLER's arm dramatically) Oh my GOD, we're going to DIE out here! And my hair isn't even camera-ready for a rescue documentary!

**LEO:** (calmly) It's probably just a coyote. They're more scared of us than—

*(Another HOWL, closer. MARCUS jumps up.)*

**MARCUS:** I don't care anymore—I'm peeing RIGHT HERE!

**MAYA/BREE/JADE:** (in unison) NO!

**TYLER:** (pointing) The bathroom's twenty feet that way, dude!

**MARCUS:** Twenty feet?! In THAT direction? Where the DEATH HOWL came from?!

**JADE:** Oh for the love of— (standing) I'll go with you, you big baby.

**MARCUS:** (relieved) Really?

**JADE:** Yes, but you're carrying the flashlight and walking in front.

**MARCUS:** Wait, what?!

*(JADE drags MARCUS offstage. Another beat of silence.)*

**BREE:** (suddenly worried) Did we remember to tell someone where we went?

**MAYA:** (checking notebook nervously) Um... no? That would've defeated the purpose of sneaking out?

**LEO:** We left at midnight, guys. It's gonna be fine. They won't even notice we're gone until morning.

*(Suddenly, BRIGHT LIGHTS flood the stage—car headlights. All three remaining teens freeze like deer.)*

**MALE VOICE (OFFSTAGE):** TYLER JAMES HENDERSON!

**FEMALE VOICE (OFFSTAGE):** MAYA LOUISE CHEN!

**TYLER:** (whispering) Oh no. Oh no no no—

**BREE:** (panicked whisper) They used middle names! We're dead!

*(JADE and MARCUS run back onstage, pants with relief.)*

**MARCUS:** (oblivious) Guys! Good news! I made it! I—(notices everyone's horrified faces) Why do you all look like that?

**JADE:** (pointing at lights) That's why.

*(Three sets of PARENTS march onstage from different directions, arms crossed. They can be played by stagehands in silhouette or implied offstage. The TEENS huddle together.)*

**MAYA:** (small voice) So... funny story...

**TYLER:** We can explain—

**FEMALE VOICE:** (offstage, furious) Find My Phone, Tyler! FIND. MY. PHONE!

**BREE:** (glaring at TYLER) You didn't turn off location services?!

**TYLER:** (defensive) I forgot, okay?!

**LEO:** (sighing, to audience) So much for freedom.

**MARCUS:** (brightening) At least there's a real bathroom at home!

*(Everyone glares at MARCUS.)

**MARCUS:** What?

*(Blackout as parents' voices overlap, scolding. The chaos grows louder until lights out completely.)*

Title: Smoke Signals

Setting: A sunny public park with a picnic shelter. Two grills stand ten feet apart like dueling pianos. A handmade banner hangs lopsided: “Annual Park Cook-Off — Hotdogs vs. Hamburgers.” Families mill about. A playground squeaks in the background. Birds, a frisbee, the faint hiss of coals.

Characters:
- Judd, a dad who loves to cook hotdogs. Competitive, charismatic, apron that says “Top Dog.”
- Jagger, a dad who loves to cook hamburgers. Competitive, cool sunglasses, apron that says “Patty Daddy.”
- Lena, 16, Judd’s daughter. Sharp, funny, steadying influence.
- Milo, 16, Jagger’s son. Kind, inventive, slightly awkward.
- Mrs. Alvarez, a no-nonsense neighbor enlisted as judge.
- Park Ranger Doug, trying his best.

(As lights rise, Judd and Jagger stand at their grills, side by side but pointedly ignoring one another. Judd cleans his grates with vigor. Jagger adjusts his spatula like a samurai sword. Lena (16) arrives carrying a basket. From the other side, Milo (16) struggles in with a crate of condiments.)

JUDD: (calling without looking) Lena, sweetheart, pass me the premium links. And the buns, the good buns! Not the ones that feel like packing foam.

LENA: (deadpan, setting basket down) Excellent. We’re focusing on mouthfeel. Very scientific.

JAGGER: Milo, my man, where’s the brioche? A patty needs a throne.

MILO: (arms full, almost trips, catches himself by colliding with Lena) Sorry! Whoa—sorry, sorry.

LENA: (laughs, steadying him) You’re fine. Condiment avalanche averted.

MILO: (sees her) Hi. I’m—uh—

JAGGER: (pointed) He’s Milo. My son. And we don’t fraternize with the enemy. (to Milo) Ketchup belongs on kid plates. Bring the aioli.

JUDD: (snorts) Aioli is just mayonnaise with a college fund. Real flavor is in the snap. (to Lena) Tongs!

(Lena and Milo exchange a quick, amused look as they each hand their dad tools.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: (striding in with a clipboard) Gentlemen! Community has placed its faith—foolishly—in your spatulas. You’ve each got twenty minutes to produce your best plate. Points for taste, presentation, and not causing the sprinkler system again.

PARK RANGER DOUG: (popping up from behind a bush, startled) I’m right here.

MRS. ALVAREZ: Yes, Doug. Yes you are. (to the dads) Begin!

(Judd slaps hotdogs onto the grill with flourish. Jagger lays down patties like gold coins. Sizzles. Smoke. Children ooh and ahh. A tiny dog eyes the table.)

JUDD: (twirling tongs) Listen to that. That’s the sound of victory and nitrates.

JAGGER: (flips a patty dramatically) Meanwhile, over here? Symphony. Maillard. Read a book.

JUDD: I did. It was called Hot Dogs: A Love Story.

JAGGER: (smirks) They don’t carry that in the adult section.

(Lena leans toward Milo, aside.)

LENA: They’ve been like this since before I could walk.

MILO: Same. Legend says they were competing in the prenatal swim class.

LENA: They probably argued over who could crawl faster. (beat) I’m Lena.

MILO: Milo. (gestures at his dad’s station) He monograms his spatulas.

LENA: Mine names his tongs. That one’s Tina.

MILO: (reverent) Hi, Tina.

(Judd reaches for a mustard bottle. It’s clogged. He shakes it vigorously, points the nozzle down. Boom. A yellow comet splatters Jagger’s apron.)

JAGGER: (freezes) Did you just…tag me in mustard?

JUDD: That was unprovoked condiment aggression! (to Lena) Napkins, go!

MILO: (to his dad) We can fix that. Stand still.

(Milo grabs a wet wipe and dabs Jagger’s apron. They all, for a moment, engage in this intimate, silly family triangle: Lena passing napkins, Milo dabbing, Judd apologizing without words.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: Ten minutes!

(Park Ranger Doug sniffs the air, suspicious. The tiny dog stealthily hops onto a bench, eyeing a lonely bun. Lena notices, stealthily slides the bun further back, slips the dog a carrot stick from her pocket. The dog sighs and gnaws.)

MILO: (quietly to Lena) You saved that bun.

LENA: I like to think I saved a pending disaster headline. (mock dramatic) “Wiener Dog Heist at Local Park.”

MILO: (laughs) I’m stealing that for a band name.

LENA: You’re in a band?

MILO: Sort of. It’s just me and a keyboard app. But—(shrugs)—I have songs.

LENA: Same. Not songs. Stage managing chaos. (gestures to their dads) Exhibit A.

(Jagger opens a jar labeled “Secret Blend.” Milo eyes it, nervous.)

MILO: Dad. That’s the sweet chili you made last night, right?

JAGGER: Yep. It’ll caramelize like a daydream.

(Milo reads the small print, alarmed.)

MILO: This says “extra ghost pepper.”

JAGGER: (sunglasses sparkle) Fearless.

(Milo glances at Lena, then deftly swaps the jar with one labeled “Mild.” Jagger doesn’t notice. Lena sees the swap, does a tiny thumbs-up.)

JUDD: (fanning his grill) Flame’s a little high. We want sizzle, not Viking funeral.

PARK RANGER DOUG: (edges closer) Gentle reminder: open flame is technically allowed until—

(Suddenly, a frisbee arcs over and slaps against Doug’s hat, flipping it into the grill’s smoke. He flails, grabs it.)

PARK RANGER DOUG: I…am fine!

(Eric, a kid from the playground, darts in, takes a burger bun and runs. Jagger points. Milo gives chase, jog-trotting, friendly.)

MILO: Hey buddy! Trade you—(fishes in pocket)—for this sticker that says “Junior Grill Sergeant”?

ERIC: Deal! (they swap, he salutes, zooms away)

(Milo returns, triumphant. He and Lena share a grin. Jagger plates a burger with care. Judd makes a spiral of ketchup on a hotdog, it looks like a miniature art piece.)

JUDD: Linares! (pronouncing like a sports announcer) Watch this flip!

(Judd tosses a hotdog, goes to catch it with a bun. The bun slips. The hotdog catapults—Lena reaches up and, with surprising grace, catches it in a spare bun one-handed.)

LENA: Got it.

(Judd beams, proud.)

JAGGER: (to Milo, competing) Son. Two-spatula double flip. Now.

(Milo obliges, flipping two patties at once. One wobbles, teeters, threatens to leap. Lena steps behind his grill and shields the patty with a plate, catching it like a goalie.)

MILO: Teamwork.

LENA: Don’t tell them.

MILO: They’d call a foul.

(Mrs. Alvarez checks her watch.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: Two minutes! Presentations, people!

(Judd arranges his plate: two dogs, one classic, one with diced onions and something crunchier. Jagger’s plate: a towering burger with lettuce lace, a cheese melt waterfall.)

LENA: (to Milo, a sudden burst of bravery) After this…do you want to maybe get a lemonade and…compare ridiculous parents?

MILO: (bright) Between refilling my dad’s ego tank? Yes. Definitely.

JUDD: (catching scraps of that) Compare what now?

LENA: Mustard types. Don’t worry about it, Dad.

JAGGER: (narrowing eyes, then realizing the time) No talk. Only burgers.

PARK RANGER DOUG: (under his breath) Only you can prevent overcooking.

MRS. ALVAREZ: Plating to the judge. Thank you.

(Judd and Jagger carry their plates like newborns. Set them in front of Mrs. Alvarez. She smells, nods, tastes. Drama. She waits. She sips water. The crowd leans in.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: Judd. The snap? Beautiful. The relish? Bright. What is that crunch?

JUDD: Crushed potato chips. Don’t tell any chef shows.

MRS. ALVAREZ: Jagger. The patty’s juicy. Balanced. No…surprise fire in my mouth. Good call.

(Milo and Lena share a conspiratorial micro-shrug.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: I declare—

(Suddenly: the park sprinklers kick on with a ch-ch-ch-tsss. A fine mist sprays. People shriek, laugh. Jagger and Judd instinctively shield their grills with their bodies like goalkeepers. Lena and Milo, without missing a beat, grab a big picnic umbrella and hold it over the plates.)

LENA: Protect the art.

MILO: We’ve got you.

(They stand close, soaked, grinning. The dads, dripping, look at the umbrella held by their kids—together.)

JUDD: (softens, sees them) …Huh.

JAGGER: (takes off sunglasses, eyes flick to Milo, to Lena) Huh.

(Mrs. Alvarez licks a raindrop off her lip, undeterred.)

MRS. ALVAREZ: I declare…a tie.

JUDD: A tie? In this economy?

JAGGER: It’s the sprinkler’s fault. They sabotaged my crust.

MRS. ALVAREZ: You both made people happy. And didn’t set Doug on fire. That’s a win.

PARK RANGER DOUG: That bar is lower than you think.

(Judd and Jagger, sputtering, then slowly laugh. The adults’ shoulders drop. The rivalry relaxes by inches. The tiny dog returns, gently sets a stolen bun at Judd’s sneaker like a peace offering.)

MILO: (to Lena, relieved) Tie is safer. Maybe we won’t have to move states.

LENA: Or change our names. Hi. I’m definitely not Elaine.

JUDD: (squints at the umbrella’s co-owners) So. That’s my girl holding an umbrella with… Jagger’s boy.

JAGGER: My boy holds good umbrellas.

JUDD: (considers) He also caught a rogue patty.

JAGGER: (grudging) And she has excellent hotdog reflexes.

LENA: We…maybe like each other.

MILO: Since, like, the grocery store lineup last week. The great bun debate of aisle six.

JUDD: (to Jagger) Aisle six? You were there?

JAGGER: We were comparing sesame seeds. Like men.

(Pause. The dads look at each other, then at their kids.)

JUDD: Tell you what. Next week…family cookout. No judges.

JAGGER: No mustard assaults.

JUDD: (extends a hand) Maybe a ceasefire.

JAGGER: (eyebrows up, shakes it) Conditional. Burgers and dogs…on the same grill.

JUDD: (mock horror, then a grin) Wild man.

LENA: Progress.

MILO: Future historians will write about this day.

MRS. ALVAREZ: I’ll write the Facebook post.

PARK RANGER DOUG: And I’ll turn off the sprinklers. Eventually.

(He wanders off, unsure of how. The crowd disperses, laughing. Judd passes a perfectly dressed hotdog to Jagger. Jagger passes a half burger to Judd. They both take bites, nod.)

JUDD: Not bad, Patty Daddy.

JAGGER: High praise, Top Dog.

(Lena and Milo lean the umbrella against the table. In the soft rain-mist, they stand a little closer. Their dads pretend not to notice and fail.)

MILO: Lemonade?

LENA: With a side of diplomatic talks.

(They head toward the lemonade stand. Judd and Jagger watch them go, then turn back to their grills, shoulder to shoulder now, adjusting heat, talking quietly about char lines as the lights dim.)

Blackout.

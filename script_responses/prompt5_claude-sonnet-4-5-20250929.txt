*(Lights up. MIKE sits in a middle seat, 14B, squeezed between DEBRA and CHILL. The plane shakes. A BABY CRIES loudly offstage.)*

**DEBRA:** *(gripping armrests, hyperventilating)* WE'RE GOING DOWN! THIS IS IT! I KNEW I SHOULD'VE TAKEN THE BUS!

**MIKE:** Ma'am, it's just a little turbulence—

**DEBRA:** A LITTLE?! THE WINGS ARE FALLING OFF! I CAN FEEL IT!

*(She grabs MIKE's arm with an iron grip.)*

**CHILL:** *(strumming guitar softly)* Hey, it's all good vibes, man. The universe has got us. *(plays a chord)* Just breathe with the rhythm...

**DEBRA:** I DON'T WANT TO BREATHE WITH THE RHYTHM! I WANT TO BREATHE ON THE GROUND!

**BRENDA:** *(from row behind)* Excuse me! Can someone do something about that baby? I paid good money for this seat!

**TODD:** *(leaning over)* You know what you need, Brenda? You need to reframe your perspective. That baby is just expressing its authentic truth.

**BRENDA:** Its authentic truth is giving me a migraine!

*(GARY unwraps a sandwich. The smell is immediate and horrific.)*

**MIKE:** *(gagging)* What... what IS that?

**GARY:** *(proud)* Limburger cheese, sardines, and onions. My wife's recipe.

**FRANCINE:** *(standing in aisle, doing downward dog)* The key is to center yourself. Namaste above the negativity.

**PETE:** *(filming with phone)* This is INSANE, you guys! *(to camera)* If this goes viral, don't forget to like and subscribe!

**JASMINE:** *(shouting into phone)* NO, DEREK, I SAID THE MERGER NEEDS TO HAPPEN BY FRIDAY! I DON'T CARE IF IT'S COMPLICATED!

**EARL:** *(to no one in particular)* This reminds me of '68, when I was in Da Nang. Except the food was worse and there were more explosions.

**TIFFANY:** *(applying lipstick in small mirror)* Does anyone have better lighting? This overhead fluorescent is terrible for contouring.

*(KEVIN's snoring reaches a crescendo. The intercom CRACKLES.)*

**SANDRA:** *(over intercom, voice shaky)* Ladies and gentlemen, this is your flight attendant speaking...

**MIKE:** *(hopeful)* Finally, someone normal—

**SANDRA:** *(breaking down)* I just... I need you all to know that Brad... Brad broke up with me. This morning. Via TEXT MESSAGE!

*(Everyone freezes. DEBRA stops hyperventilating.)*

**SANDRA:** *(crying)* We were together for THREE YEARS! We had PLANS! We were going to get a DOG! *(sobbing)* And he said I was "emotionally unavailable"! ME! I'm a FLIGHT ATTENDANT! I'm literally available at 30,000 feet!

**CHILL:** *(softly)* Heavy, man...

**SANDRA:** And you know what the worst part is?! *(voice rising)* He changed his Facebook status before he even texted me! FACEBOOK! Who even uses Facebook anymore?!

**DEBRA:** *(quietly)* I use Facebook...

**SANDRA:** He said he needed "space"! SPACE?! I WORK IN A METAL TUBE IN THE SKY! I UNDERSTAND SPACE! *(full breakdown)* And now I have to serve you people tiny bags of pretzels while my HEART IS BREAKING!

**TODD:** You know, Sandra, what you're experiencing is a chance for growth—

**SANDRA:** *(unhinged)* WE'RE OUT OF PRETZELS, TODD! THERE IS NO GROWTH! ONLY PAIN!

*(The plane hits major turbulence. Everyone screams except CHILL and KEVIN, who sleeps through it.)*

**DEBRA:** WE'RE DEFINITELY DYING NOW!

**FRANCINE:** *(falling over mid-tree pose)* Not my zen!

**GARY:** *(sandwich falls)* MY SANDWICH!

**PETE:** *(still filming)* THIS IS GOING TO GET SO MANY VIEWS!

**MIKE:** *(to audience, breaking fourth wall)* I'm seventeen years old. I just wanted to visit my grandma. She makes good cookies. That's it. That's ALL I wanted.

*(SANDRA comes on intercom again, composing herself slightly.)*

**SANDRA:** We'll be landing in Fort Lauderdale in approximately... *(starts crying again)* ...Brad loved Fort Lauderdale... *(sobbing)* ...twenty minutes.

**MIKE:** *(head in hands)* Twenty minutes. I can survive twenty minutes.

**DEBRA:** *(grabbing him again)* WILL WE THOUGH?!

**CHILL:** *(strumming)* ♪ *All we need is love...* ♪

**BABY:** *(offstage, louder than ever)* WAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

**EVERYONE:** *(except KEVIN and CHILL, in unison)* AHHHHHHH!

*(Lights flicker. Blackout.)*

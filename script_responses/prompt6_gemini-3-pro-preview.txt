**Title:** The Great Escape (To The Backyard of Nature)

**Characters:**

*   **MARCUS (Male):** The self-appointed leader. Has a clipboard. Takes things way too seriously.
*   **CHAD (Male):** The Varsity Captain. Physically imposing, emotionally fragile. Terrified of moths.
*   **LEO (Male):** The Slacker. Asleep for 90% of the trip. Always hungry.
*   **BRITTANY (Female):** High maintenance. Wearing white designer sneakers to the woods. Has a bladder the size of a thimble.
*   **SAM (Female):** True Crime addict. Convinced every sound is a serial killer.
*   **JESS (Female):** The toxic optimist. Trying desperately to make memories.

**Setting:**
*A clearing in the woods, 3:00 AM. Total darkness save for a dying lantern. Two tents are pitched haphazardly: one looks like a collapsed lung, the other is taut but vibrating with fear. Forest sounds are amplified.*

[SCENE START]

**(The stage is dark. A twig SNAPS loudly. Sudden, panicked heavy breathing is heard.)**

**SAM:** (Whispering intensely) That’s it. That’s the unsub. We’re the cold open of a Dateline episode.

**JESS:** (Cheerfully strained) It’s just the wind, Sam! The whispering, magical wind of our freedom!

**BRITTANY:** (Whining from the collapsed tent) Guys, I can’t do this. I have to go again.

**MARCUS:** (Popping head out of the taut tent, wearing a headlamp that blinds everyone) Brittany, negative. You peed four minutes ago. That is physically impossible. We are on a strict hydration schedule!

**BRITTANY:** I have a nervous bladder, Marcus! And there’s a spider in here wearing a top hat. I swear it looked at me.

**CHAD:** (Voice cracking, from inside Marcus’s tent) Was it big? If it’s big, I’m not coming out. I’m the muscle of this group, I need to preserve my strength for... bigger threats.

**SAM:** It’s not a spider. It’s the Skinner Brothers. They live in these woods. They wear human faces as masks.

**LEO:** ( muffled, from inside a sleeping bag) ...did someone say pizza?

**MARCUS:** No one said pizza, Leo! Go back to sleep. Listen, Team Alpha, we stole our parents’ cars and drove forty miles to proving ground *freedom*. We are seniors. We are adults. We do not fear the night!

**(A loud RUSTLE in the bushes. A low, guttural GROWL echoes. It sounds vaguely like a pug with asthma, but in the dark, it’s terrifying.)**

**CHAD:** (Screaming) BEAR! IT’S A GRIZZLY! SAVE YOURSELVES!

**(Chad bursts out of the tent, holding a plastic spork as a weapon. He trips over a tent peg and face-plants into the dirt.)**

**SAM:** It’s not a bear. Bears don’t chitter. It’s a Chupacabra. Or a feral clown.

**BRITTANY:** (Emerging from her tent, hopping on one foot) I don’t care if it’s Godzilla, I am peeing behind that bush!

**JESS:** Wait! We can’t separate! That’s how the friendship montage ends and the tragedy begins! Let’s just... sing? *Kumbaya, my Lord...*

**(The RUSTLE gets closer. Everyone freezes. Marcus adjusts his headlamp to spotlight a bush stage left.)**

**MARCUS:** Target acquired. Chad, flank left. Leo, wake up and look menacing.

**LEO:** (Sitting up, hair a mess, holding a bag of marshmallows) Brah, is that a raccoon?

**MARCUS:** It’s a beast of the wild!

**(A tiny, fluffy SQUIRREL hops out. It stares at them. It sneezes.)**

**CHAD:** (From the dirt) Is it gone? Did I kill it?

**SAM:** It’s a decoy. The killer trains squirrels to lure teens into a false sense of security. It’s classic psychological warfare.

**BRITTANY:** (Running back from the bush) Okay, false alarm. It was just a panic-tinkle. But I ruined my Yeezys. My life is over.

**JESS:** Guys, look at the stars! We’re doing it! We’re defying authority!

**LEO:** I’m hungry. I think I left a sandwich in the glove box of your mom’s minivan, Marcus.

**MARCUS:** We are not going back to the extraction point! My dad thinks I’m at a math decathlon. If we go back now, the itinerary is ruined. 0400 hours is sunrise meditation!

**(Suddenly, blindingly bright LED HEADLIGHTS wash over the entire stage from the audience’s direction. A police siren WOOP-WOOPs once.)**

**AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.):** (Ideally a very angry Dad voice) MARCUS ANTHONY MILLER. I KNOW YOU ARE NOT DOING CALCULUS IN THE WOODS.

**CHAD:** ( weeping) It’s the Feds. I’m too pretty for prison.

**SAM:** Oh my god. It’s worse than a serial killer. It’s... *The Parents*.

**AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.):** BRITTANY, YOUR MOTHER CAN TRACK YOUR PHONE. SHE SAYS YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS TO GET IN THIS CAR BEFORE SHE DONATES YOUR WARDROBE TO CHARITY.

**BRITTANY:** (Gasps) Not the vintage Prada! (She sprints toward the light).

**LEO:** (Standing up) Do they have snacks in the car?

**MARCUS:** (Defeated, dropping his clipboard) Mission compromised. Abort. Abort.

**JESS:** (As they all walk shamefully toward the lights) Well... at least we’ll be grounded together? That’s kind of magical, right?

**CHAD:** (Still holding the spork) I think I pulled a hammy. Carry me?

**(Blackout.)**

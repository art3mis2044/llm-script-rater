**Senior Trip: A Horror Story**

**Characters:**

*   **LEO:** (M) The meticulous planner. He has a laminated itinerary. He is currently on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
*   **CHLOE:** (F) The influencer. Everything is content. If it isn't filmed, it didn't happen.
*   **JAKE:** (M) The jock. Big muscles, bigger fears. Thinks "roughing it" is a hotel without room service.
*   **MAYA:** (F) The anxious one. Has a first-aid kit for her first-aid kit. Has a notoriously small bladder.
*   <strong>SAM:</strong> (M) The cynic. He's only here for the schadenfreude. Armed with a bottomless supply of sarcasm.
*   **BELLA:** (F) The chill one. The only person who actually knows how to camp. She's deeply unimpressed with everyone.
*   **MRS. PETERSON:** (F) Leo’s mom. Not angry, just disappointed (which is worse).
*   **MR. DAVIS:** (M) Jake’s dad. Definitely angry.

**Setting:**

A dark, unwelcoming patch of woods. Two cheap-looking tents are pitched crookedly. A single, pathetic solar-powered lantern casts long, spooky shadows. It is nighttime.

**(The scene opens. LEO is pacing frantically outside the tents. JAKE is shivering inside the boys' tent, which is zipped up tight. SAM is sitting on a log, poking a smoldering fire with a stick. CHLOE is trying to find a signal for her phone, holding it up to the sky like an offering. BELLA is calmly trying to re-peg one of the tents. MAYA is hopping from foot to foot.)**

**LEO**
(Muttering to himself)
Okay. 11:04 PM. Phase four, "Stargazing and S'mores," is officially a catastrophic failure. The s'mores caught on fire and the stars are… cloudy. We are three hours behind schedule.

**MAYA**
Leo, I have to go again.

**LEO**
(Not looking at her)
Again? Maya, that’s the fifth time in an hour! We’re losing precious hydration. It’s not on the itinerary!

**MAYA**
My bladder doesn't consult your laminated schedule! It’s dark out there. There could be… badgers. Or worse, poison ivy in a place you do *not* want poison ivy.

**SAM**
(Without looking up from the fire)
Don't worry, Maya. The bears will get you before the rash sets in. It’s much quicker.

**(JAKE’s head pokes out of the boys' tent, eyes wide.)**

**JAKE**
Did someone say bears? I knew this was a bad idea. My dad’s going to kill me. Then a bear is going to kill me. I’m going to be double-killed!

**CHLOE**
(Lowering her phone, frustrated)
Ugh, zero bars. My followers are going to think I’ve been ghosted. Can we at least get some drama going? Jake, can you pretend a bear is attacking you for my Story? Make it authentic. Hashtag survival.

**BELLA**
(Finally hammering a tent peg in with a rock)
There. Now this tent will only collapse if someone breathes on it too hard. And if you want authentic, Chloe, go smell the pit toilet.

**(A loud SNAP is heard from the woods just beyond their campsite. Everyone freezes. JAKE shrieks and disappears back into the tent.)**

**MAYA**
(Whispering)
What was that?

**LEO**
It’s… it’s probably a deer! A majestic, woodland creature. All part of the experience.
(He tries to sound confident, but his voice is an octave too high.)

**SAM**
Yeah, a deer that just stepped on a twig with the force of a 200-pound man wearing steel-toed boots.

**JAKE**
(From inside the tent, muffled)
IT'S BIGFOOT! I SAW A DOCUMENTARY! THEY'RE DRAWN TO THE SCENT OF TEENAGE FEAR AND CHEAP COLOGNE!

**CHLOE**
(Fumbling with her phone)
Ooh, Bigfoot! The algorithm will love this. Okay, everyone look terrified but, like, in a cute way.

**(Another, louder CRUNCH comes from the darkness. It sounds closer. MAYA lets out a small whimper.)**

**MAYA**
That’s it. My bladder has officially given up. I don't care about the badgers anymore. I’m making a run for it. Bella, come with me!

**BELLA**
No way. My survival instincts are telling me not to be your designated "creature-bait."

**LEO**
Nobody move! According to the plan, in the event of an unidentified woodland threat, we are to form a defensive circle and… and…
(He frantically checks his laminated sheet.)
I didn't plan for an unidentified woodland threat!

**(As panic reaches its peak, a blindingly bright beam of light cuts through the darkness, illuminating the entire pathetic scene. The teenagers squint, frozen like deer in headlights. The light is coming from a heavy-duty flashlight.)**

**A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)**
Leonard Peterson. I believe you have my nine-person, all-weather tent that you said you were borrowing for a "school project."

**(MRS. PETERSON and MR. DAVIS step into the light. Mrs. Peterson is holding the flashlight, looking disappointed. Mr. Davis is built like a refrigerator and is holding a bag of marshmallows they left in the car.)**

**LEO**
(Weakly)
Mom?

**MR. DAVIS**
(To Jake’s tent)
Jacob, you have five seconds to get out of that nylon prison before I mistake it for a very lumpy, very grounded piñata.

**(JAKE scrambles out of the tent, tripping over the zipper.)**

**JAKE**
Dad! You found us! Oh, thank goodness, I thought we were going to be eaten!

**CHLOE**
(Whispering to Bella, filming the parents)
This is amazing content. The parental bust. It’s a classic trope.

**MRS. PETERSON**
(Her gaze sweeping over the chaotic scene)
The dream senior trip, was it? Looks more like a nightmare you have after eating bad calamari. Everyone, pack it up. You’re all grounded until college.

**MAYA**
(Sighs in relief)
Oh, thank you! Does your car have a bathroom?

**SAM**
(Tossing his stick into the dying fire)
Well, on the bright side, we get to sleep in real beds tonight.

**(He smirks. The parents glare. LEO looks like he might faint.)**

**(BLACKOUT.)**

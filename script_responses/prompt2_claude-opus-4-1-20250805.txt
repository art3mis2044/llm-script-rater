**WEDNESDAY MORNING MADNESS**

*A modest but cheerful kitchen. A small table with four chairs, counters cluttered with breakfast items. MOM (40s, still in her robe) frantically scrambles eggs. DAD (40s, half-dressed with tie undone) reads his phone while buttering toast. LILY (16, earbuds in) texts obsessively. JAKE (12, pajamas) builds a cereal fort. A large golden retriever, BISCUIT, weaves between everyone's legs.*

**MOM**: *(flipping eggs)* Jake, please eat your cereal, don't architect with it.

**JAKE**: It's a fortress against Wednesday, Mom. Wednesdays are scientifically proven to be the worst.

**DAD**: *(not looking up)* That's not science, buddy. That's opinion.

**JAKE**: Same thing.

**LILY**: *(removing one earbud)* Can someone drive me early? Madison's having a crisis and I need to be there.

**MOM**: What kind of crisis?

**LILY**: Brad looked at Chelsea in chemistry.

**DAD**: *(sarcastically)* Oh no. Call the National Guard.

**LILY**: You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're like, ancient.

*BISCUIT barks. The toast pops up, completely charred.*

**DAD**: Perfect. *(waves smoke away)* Third time's the charm?

**MOM**: There's no more bread.

**DAD**: Even better.

*JAKE accidentally knocks over his cereal fortress, sending milk everywhere.*

**JAKE**: BISCUIT DID IT!

**BISCUIT**: *(tail wagging, starts lapping up spilled milk)*

**MOM**: Jake! The truth, please!

**JAKE**: Okay, but technically Biscuit's tail was involved.

*LILY stands abruptly, knocking her orange juice onto DAD's phone.*

**LILY**: OH MY GOD!

**DAD**: MY PHONE!

**LILY**: No—Madison says Brad is now looking at JENNIFER!

**DAD**: *(shaking phone)* This is a company phone!

**MOM**: Rice! We need rice! Jake, get rice!

**JAKE**: *(running to pantry)* Why do phones eat rice?

**MOM**: They don't eat it, they—JAKE, NO!

*JAKE trips over BISCUIT, sending rice EVERYWHERE like confetti.*

**JAKE**: ...Oops?

*The smoke alarm starts BEEPING. Everyone freezes.*

**DAD**: The eggs.

*MOM spins around to see the eggs burning. She grabs the pan, accidentally flinging an egg onto the ceiling where it sticks.*

**MOM**: *(staring up)* Well. That's new.

**LILY**: This is literally the worst morning ever.

**JAKE**: See? Wednesdays ARE scientifically terrible!

**DAD**: *(checking his watch)* And we need to leave in exactly... negative five minutes.

*Long pause. Everyone looks at each other. The egg falls from the ceiling onto BISCUIT's head. He shakes it off happily.*

**MOM**: *(removing apron)* McDonald's?

**EVERYONE**: McDonald's.

**DAD**: I'll get the car keys.

**LILY**: Can we still stop at Madison's?

**JAKE**: Can I get two hash browns?

**MOM**: *(looking at the destroyed kitchen)* Can we move?

*BISCUIT barks cheerfully, tail wagging, rice still stuck to his fur.*

**DAD**: *(opening door)* Come on, disaster family. Let's go fail at Wednesday somewhere else.

**JAKE**: *(triumphantly)* I TOLD you Wednesdays were the worst!

*They all exit, leaving the kitchen in complete chaos. The smoke alarm continues beeping. After a beat, the egg on the ceiling falls again.*
